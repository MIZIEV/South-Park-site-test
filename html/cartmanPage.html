                    <p>Eric Theodore Cartman, usually referred to as just Cartman, is one of the main characters, along
                        with
                        Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Kenny McCormick. Cartman is sometimes the main antagonist of an
                        episode, for example "Trapper Keeper". None of the other three main children really consider
                        Cartman
                        their friend and do not know why they started hanging out with him in the first place, but a
                        certain
                        form of unstable friendship ends up being born between them. However he is usually Kyle's first
                        choice
                        when he breaks his friendship with Stan. In earlier episodes, Kenny was his best friend,
                        however, in
                        later seasons, Butters Stotch is usually depicted as such.</p>

                    <p>Cartman was the first one of the boys to be shown without his hat, as seen in "Merry Christmas
                        Charlie Manson!". He also weighs 90 pounds, as revealed in "Weight Gain 4000".</p>
                </div>

                <div id="appearance">

                    <h4>Appearance</h4>

                    <p>Cartman wears a red jacket, yellow mittens, a blue hat with a yellow puff ball on top, brown
                        pants,
                        black shoes, and white socks (as seen in "Super Fun Time"). He sometimes wears a green t-shirt
                        with
                        a bear picture on under his jacket, a white tank top, and occasionally a dark red t-shirt. He
                        has
                        medium-brown hair and a double-chin. He also has triangular-shaped eyebrows, in contrast to the
                        other main boys' rectangular ones. Even though Cartman is overweight, he always denies it
                        (especially in the earlier seasons) by saying, "I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned", or some
                        variation
                        thereof. However, as seen in "Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!" and "Cartmanland", his weight
                        problem
                        may be, in truth, be genetic and runs in the family, as seen by the fact that, with the
                        exception of
                        his mother an aunt, and a cousin, his entire family is extremely overweight. But in "Fat Camp",
                        when
                        he tells his mother to talk about how he is big boned and such, she instead says, "Those were
                        all
                        lies, sweetie, you're just fat." In "Tsst", he is slightly thinner, although in later episodes,
                        he
                        was shown to have regained the lost weight. Cartman likely has blue irises, as, due to the
                        events of
                        "The Succubus", he has Kenny's eyes, which were shown with blue in "Starvin' Marvin". In Season
                        Twenty, he wears a t-shirt with the words "Token's Life Matters".</p>

                    <p>In the future timeline set in South Park: Post Covid, Cartman is supposedly converted into
                        Judaism.
                        He wears a dark gray suit with black tie and white shirt, along with a pair of round glasses.
                        His
                        yarmulke resembles the blue hat with yellow puff that he wears in childhood.</p>
                </div>


                <div id="personality">
                    <h4>Personality</h4>

                    <p>Cartman is described in various terms, in short, he is an evil, vicious, angry, self-absorbed,
                        immature, destructive, sarcastic, snooty, loud-mouthed, lazy, and insane child. He is the most
                        foul-mouthed character in the show. He is also racist and stereotypes almost everyone he sees.
                        The
                        very dark, usually disturbing undertones to his personality often hint at an extreme mental
                        imbalance. Apart from being portrayed as having a general lack of moral responsibility or social
                        conscience, he also seems to take pleasure from others' misfortune and is generally unable to
                        show
                        empathy, although there have been exceptions, such as in "How to Eat with Your Butt." Despite
                        the
                        severity of his actions, it is likely that they are a type of emotional defense mechanism
                        against
                        his insecurity and (potential) confused sexuality. This "defense", however, does not seem to be
                        impenetrable, as evidenced by "1%". This has been parodied as well, in the clich√© of a typical
                        villain becoming benevolent. In these episodes, he usually convinces Kyle that he has good
                        intentions, such as in the "Cartoon Wars" two-parter, where Cartman appears to Kyle that he is
                        concerned about people's safety at the beginning, but it is later shown to only have been doing
                        it
                        to get Family Guy off the air. In the "Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?" and "Probably"
                        two-parter,
                        Kyle and many others fall for Cartman's apparently "good intentions" for trying to prevent the
                        children of South Park from going to hell. However, it is revealed that he only did it so he
                        could
                        earn money. In "Kenny Dies", he is distraught at Kenny's impending death leading Kyle to console
                        him. Later when his supposedly real motives were revealed, knowing how Cartman typically is,
                        Kyle
                        promptly fights him in Kenny's defense, although Cartman was genuinely distraught over Kenny's
                        illness before and after he learns that he can benefit from it. This clearly shows that Cartman
                        went
                        through Congress for Kenny and reveals that he does not have a healthy way of dealing with the
                        death
                        of his friend.</p>

                    <p>Cartman can, on rare occasions, show compassion towards cats, as in "Major Boobage" in which he
                        hides
                        cats in his attic from the authorities. This compassion hints that he has not progressed to be a
                        full sociopath.F</p>

                    <p>In "The Death of Eric Cartman", Kyle sums up Cartman's character as a "fat, racist,
                        self-centered,
                        intolerant, manipulative sociopath".</p>

                        class="cartman-image-personality img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Eric Cartman image">

                    <p>He has been shown to harass and bully people at his school, and, as a result, many people in the
                        show
                        despise him. Cartman, however, does not consider himself to be a bully who likes to pick on
                        other
                        people to pleasure himself; in fact, he seems to disregard good or bad altogether (or perhaps
                        simply
                        does not have a concept of it) and does whatever he feels necessary for him to get ahead.
                        Cartman
                        seems to be motivated not so much by personal gain as by asserting superiority over others. In
                        "Red
                        Hot Catholic Love", he won $20 in a bet with Kyle, but, instead of using the money, he simply
                        kept
                        flaunting it in front of Kyle until Kyle conceded that Cartman was right, ruining his sense of
                        victory and causing him to throw a tantrum (and apparently even abandon the money and having it
                        given back to Kyle). The same thing happens in "Christian Rock Hard": Kyle makes a $10 bet that
                        he
                        can get a platinum album before Cartman, Cartman makes a successful album and makes millions of
                        dollars and earning the album. But, when Cartman wins a myrrh album and discovers that the
                        Christian
                        companies do not give out platinum albums (Christ did not believe in such things, the albums
                        stem
                        from the gifts of the three wise men; they give out gold, frankincense, and myrrh albums), thus
                        meaning he cannot win the bet, he angrily destroys the myrrh album, showing that he did not care
                        how
                        he just made millions of dollars, he just wanted to beat Kyle in a bet.</p>

                    <p>Cartman's much quoted line, "Respect my authority" (or as Cartman pronounces it, "respect mah
                        authori-tah") highlights his power hungry and dictatorial characteristics. Despite these traits,
                        Cartman rarely commands respect from his peers. Cartman's friendships with the other kids are
                        clearly existent, but just not shown as much because of his personality.</p>

                    <p>Ironically, despite (or perhaps because of) these qualities, Cartman also seems to be a natural
                        leader, able to utilize overwhelming charisma and rhetoric to gain the obedience of large groups
                        on
                        a moment's notice (as in "The Passion of the Jew"), appearing to be innately aware of how to
                        take
                        advantage of "mob mentality" and direct it toward accomplishing his personal goals, as has been
                        evidenced in countless episodes throughout the series' history. In situations where the other
                        boys
                        share his goals, Cartman is often the de facto leader (e.g. "Make Love, Not Warcraft", "The
                        List",
                        and "Marjorine"). Indeed, the others consistently show a willingness to follow him and trust in
                        his
                        leadership when he is using his abilities for "good."</p>

                    <p>Cartman also seems to share many of the shows creators' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) more
                        controversial opinions, despite both of them modeling Stan and Kyle after themselves. Examples
                        of
                        this include an extremely strong dislike for Family Guy for its lack of character development,
                        plot,
                        or smart humor. Other examples include Cartman's strong distaste of hippies, to the point that
                        he
                        has personally kept them out of South Park since he was 4 years old, and his belittlement of the
                        Catholic Church as extremist, homophobic, and a supporter of pedophiles (in "Medicinal Fried
                        Chicken"). He also considers John Lennon to be the "king of hippies".</p>

                <div id="greed">

                    <h4>Greed</h4>

                    <p>A defining arc during the show's fourth season was Cartman's single-minded quest to make 10
                        million
                        dollars. The schemes he has tried include; becoming a part of the Denver "tooth racket"; and
                        stealing Tooth Fairy money from kids, starting a boy band called Fingerbang, and forming his own
                        church and embezzling its collection money These all failed miserably for several reasons. He
                        also
                        tried at it in the episode "Cherokee Hair Tampons" when Kyle's kidneys were failing and Cartman,
                        being the only one with Kyle's blood type, demanded a payment of 10 million dollars when Stan
                        begged
                        him to let Kyle have his kidney. He has also tried to sell a crashed truck-load of aborted
                        fetuses
                        to the highest-bidding stem cell research center, and even to a restaurant as food. In "Up the
                        Down
                        Steroid", Cartman had also pretended he was retarded to compete in the Special Olympics and win
                        $1000. The reasons for this are never fully explained, although in one episode "Cartmanland",
                        after
                        inheriting a million dollars from his grandmother, he reveals that he wishes to buy his own
                        amusement park so he would not have to wait in lines for the rides. He also stated that it has
                        been
                        his dream to own a million dollars since he was two years old. In "Two Days Before the Day After
                        Tomorrow", he threatens Kyle with a gun for his "Jew Gold". In "ManBearPig" Cartman stumbles
                        upon a
                        pile of treasure while the boys are trapped in a system of caves. Afraid that the others might
                        find
                        the treasure and demand a share, Cartman decides to swallow as many of the coins and jewels as
                        he
                        can, causing him to become extremely bloated and unable to walk or swim on his own. Later in the
                        episode it is revealed, during the process of painfully crapping it out, that the treasure is
                        fake
                        and used for photographs for tourists at the caves. He is miserably and completely scrooged,
                        determined not to give up the slightest amount of money, such as refusing to give a dollar to
                        Afghan
                        children in "Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants", "I'm not giving a dollar to those towel-heads!"
                        Craig
                        Tucker observed in "Fishsticks" that Jimmy was lucky Cartman was only asking for half the money
                        that
                        would be made from patenting a joke that Jimmy had come up with, and Cartman was intent on
                        taking
                        credit for (he had actually lied on the couch eating chips, offering no input).</p>

                    <h4>Sport</h4>

                    <p>Cartman has been bad at sports, and sometimes good. He has been seen playing center in Football
                        in
                        "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride" and on the Dodge-Ball team in the episode "Conjoined Fetus
                        Lady".
                        He plays Baseball, as he is seen hitting a home run and plays catcher on the Baseball team, as
                        seen
                        as one of the three players (Stan, Kyle, and Cartman) hitting a home run in "The Losing Edge".

                    <p>In "Grey Dawn" he is seen playing street hockey along with the rest of the boys as a goalie. In
                        later
                        episodes "ManBearPig" and "Guitar Queer-O", Cartman is seen to be playing basketball with the
                        other
                        boys, however he is not nearly as talented as he seems to think or the others. He often cries
                        out
                        'Stop cheating you black asshole!' when an opponent beats him, or 'You tricked me!' as if this
                        was
                        illegal. However, Cartman seems to have a grasp of cheating strategies (as seen in "Eek, A
                        Penis!".)
                        Cartman tries out for the wrestling team in "W.T.F.", but leaves after he is put into a "gay"
                        move
                        by Butters, who was told by the teacher to do so. In the same episode he formed a wrestling
                        league
                        along with some of the other boys. However, the wrestling in which they performed was more
                        dramatic
                        theater in which they created complicated in depth story lines for their wrestling personas,
                        rather
                        than actual athletic prowess.</p>

                    <p>Cartman is also seen as a not very good swimmer in "Summer Sucks". Cartman is upstaged by
                        handicapped
                        children in "Up the Down Steroid", where his elaborate plan to beat the handicapped children in
                        athletics backfires, with him placing dead last in every sport. In "1%", he performed so poorly
                        on
                        the school's gym athletics test that it brought the school's average down to the worst in the
                        country.</p>

                <div id="Trivia">
                    <h4>Trivia</h4>

                    <li>Cartman has Kenny's eyes, due to the events in the subplot of "The Succubus".</li>
                    <li>Kyle has one of Cartman's kidneys due to the events of "Cherokee Hair Tampons".</li>
                    <li>It is most likely that Cartman is the youngest of the four friends. His birthday was in the
                        first
                        season, and it has been clear that he turned 8, while the other boys already were 8 years old.
                        However, Stan made it clear that Cartman and all the other boys were ten years old in "Crack
                        Baby
                        Athletic Association" while Stan was still nine years old only to turn ten two episodes later.
                        It
                        could be that the birth dates of all the boys were called out randomly and their permanent
                        birthdays
                        set in later. This mix up made Stan the youngest of the four boys.</li>
                    <li>Cartman is mostly known by his family name, and most characters, including Stan, Kyle, Wendy,
                        and
                        Tolkien, call him by his surname.</li>
                    <li>In "Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000", it is shown that Stan and Kyle pick on Cartman because he
                        is
                        fat, not because of his many crimes.</li>
                    <li>Cartman has been shown to go to great lengths to get revenge on people who did relatively minor
                        things. An example is in "Tsst", where Cartman made a kid saw off his own leg and get him sent
                        to
                        the hospital just because the kid called him chubby. Despite this, he never does something like
                        this
                        on any of his friends, despite the fact that they have called him much worse names than
                        "chubby". He
                        also has never arranged a gambit to get Wendy's parents killed like he did Scott Tenorman's,
                        despite
                        the fact that what Wendy did to Cartman was worse than what Scott did. Why he has not done these
                        things yet is not yet known, although it is shown that Wendy can occasionally outsmart Cartman
                        and
                        turn his schemes against him. Cartman may not have sought extreme revenge on Wendy due to his
                        feelings for her; it is shown that he likes Wendy in "Chef Goes Nanners". Cartman sends a fake
                        police report to a psychiatrist's wife, who then commits suicide; It can be assumed that he knew
                        she
                        would do so, as he is a master of manipulation.</li>
                    <li>Cartman maintains somewhat friendly relationships with most of the boys at his school and is
                        shown
                        playing with them on occasion, despite the fact that all the kids openly hate him, though this
                        is
                        considered a love/hate relationship that he shares with the boys.</li>
                    <li>In the episode "Chickenpox", the boys sleep at Kenny's house. When they rolled out their
                        sleeping
                        bags, Kyle and Stan both had Terrance and Phillip and Cartman had Urkel from Family Matters on
                        his.
                    </li>
                    <li>According to the girls, Cartman is the ugliest boy in their class, likely because of his weight.
                        He
                        is the only one not invited to the girls' party in "Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset".F</li>
                    <li>In the "The Unaired Pilot", Cartman was originally scripted to have a father and a sister.
                        However,
                        they had no speaking lines and were cut for the official pilot onward.</li>
                    <li>He is the only one of the fourth graders to have noticed Kenny's reoccurring deaths, as shown in
                        "Cartmanland".</li>
                    <li>Cartman saved Kyle for the sole reason to pick on him and have something to do in "Smug Alert!",
                        despite his apparent desire to kill or get rid of Kyle.</li>
