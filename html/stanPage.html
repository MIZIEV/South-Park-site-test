                    <h4>Generally</h4>

                    <p>Stanley "Stan" Marsh is one of South Park's main characters along with Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman,
                        and Kenny McCormick.</p>

                    <p>Stan attends South Park Elementary as part of Mr. Garrison's Fourth Grade Class (formerly Third).
                        Stan's father Randy is a geologist, and his mother Sharon is a secretary at Tom's Rhinoplasty. He
                        briefly had a step-father in "Clubhouses", named Roy.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="appearance">
                    <h4>Appearance</h4>

                    <img src="../img/characters/Stan_Marsh.png" class="stan-image-main img-thumbnail rounded"
                        alt="Stan Marsh image">

                    <p>Stan is mostly shown wearing a brown jacket with a red collar, a blue hat with a red puffball and
                        rim, and blue jeans. Under his jacket, he either wears a red and blue baseball shirt or a white
                        T-shirt/v-neck. He also wears a blue Terrance and Phillip shirt to bed and a green suit for special
                        occasions. In some episodes, it is clear he has black hair (like his father Randy) when his hat is
                        partially or completely removed - this was first seen in "A Very Crappy Christmas".</p>

                    <p>All of the boys' hats are removed and their hair is seen for an extended period during the shower
                        room scene in "Lil' Crime Stoppers", although Kenny's head is only seen from behind. Stan also
                        apparently has blue eyes, as noted by Kyle when Butters draws their cartoon forms in "A Very Crappy
                        Christmas", but this is uncertain, because Kyle said it was similar because he had a sharper nose,
                        so it could have been a mistake.</p>

                    <p>In "Good Times with Weapons", he was portrayed with brown eyes, so odds are it was Butters' error
                        when his eyes were blue. Even at a young age, Stan has always worn his red and blue hat (as shown in
                        "Pre-School") and even sleeps with it on.</p>

                    <p>In "The List", he ranked third in the initial corrupt list of which boy was cutest. However, he was
                        not mentioned among those who had to change places due to the corruption, so it is possible that he
                        remained the third cutest boy, behind Clyde (who was actually in the bottom five somewhere) and Tolkien.</p>

                    <p>In the original Christmas short, he had a different appearance; his hat was the same, but it was
                        fully red, he also had a dot as a nose and his jacket was blue.</p>

                    <p>In the future timeline set in South Park: Post Covid, his hair is graying on the sides, and he has a
                        five-o' clock shadow. He wears a red long-sleeved shirt with brown vest, blue pants, and black shoes.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="personality">
                    <h4>Personality</h4>

                    <p>Stan is generally the most tender and sensitive of the four boys. For example, in "Kenny Dies",
                        he
                        finds it difficult to see Kenny in his ill state, and in "Raisins" he becomes depressed after
                        losing
                        his girlfriend to Tolkien. Also, in "Fun with Veal", Stan is the only one who stopped eating
                        meat
                        completely when the boys found that veal was actually "tortured baby cow meat". However, in some
                        episodes he does not seem to care when people die, as in "Dances with Smurfs" and "Chef Goes
                        Nanners".</p>

                    <p>Stan is often very moral. This is evident in "Cherokee Hair Tampons", when he, Kenny, Timmy, and
                        Butters challenged the character Miss Information and her shop of alternative medicine, in
                        "Super
                        Best Friends", when he helped battle David Blaine's suicidal cult, and in "The Biggest Douche in
                        the
                        Universe" where he accuses the psychic medium, John Edward, of being a fake. In this episode he
                        also
                        gained possession of his own show (while trying to prove that cold reading was fake) and battled
                        with John Edward in a "Psychic Showdown".</p>

                    <p>He also showed some heroism in "Cherokee Hair Tampons" by stating he would gladly donate a kidney
                        to
                        Kyle, even if it "hurt a whole lot". In "Whale Whores", he was also the only one in South Park
                        to
                        stand up and help whales and dolphins that were being slaughtered by the Japanese. He was angry
                        that
                        the cast of Whale Wars was not doing enough to help whales and dolphins and took matters into
                        his
                        own hands. It also shows Stan is a whale and dolphin lover and he tells the Japanese that it was
                        a
                        cow and a chicken that nuked Hiroshima, not a whale and a dolphin, in order to save them all
                        being
                        wiped out by the Japanese.</p>

                    <p>He is usually the one who is unaffected by the many scams, cults, and mass influences that South
                        Park
                        has been subjected to, and has a knack for seeing through falsely glorified practices and
                        celebrities. In "Trapped in the Closet" and "Ass Burgers", he is the only one of the boys shown
                        to
                        believe in scams, cults, and that an alien makes everyone see things normal. Conversely,
                        sometimes
                        Kyle takes on this role, and it is Stan who is the gullible one, such as in "Chinpokomon", or
                        the
                        metrosexual trend in "South Park is Gay!".</p>

                    <img src="../img/characters/stan_marsh/stan_personality.webp"
                        class="stan-image-personality img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Stan Marsh image">

                    <p>However, Stan has been shown to have an overwhelmingly clearer understanding of scams and
                        corporate
                        corruption than anyone else in South Park, and has an especially good grasp of the dangers of
                        cults.
                        It is notable that he has a tendency to ridicule, make enemies out of, and/or bring shame to a
                        very
                        large number of celebrities that are shown in a poor light within the show. This may be because
                        his
                        father (Stan's major adult influence) has shown to be rather incompetent and immature, so Stan
                        is
                        suspicious and distrustful of adults.</p>

                    <p>Stan and Kyle's personalities tend to be similar, especially in the earlier seasons, but are not
                        quite interchangeable, and they have developed more distinct and complex personalities during
                        the
                        show's run. Still, they are considered the closest friends out of the four, though Cartman and
                        Kenny
                        do not have a close bond of their own.</p>

                    <p>Stan's depression is also a recurring theme throughout the show. He became terribly depressed
                        when
                        Wendy broke up with him in "Raisins", briefly joining the Goth Kids. Stan also became incredibly
                        depressed and adopted a cynical world view in "You're Getting Old" and "Ass Burgers", where
                        everything to him literally sounded and looked "like shit". In "Ass Burgers", he uses alcohol to
                        make the world seem happier.</p>

                    <p>Stan may suffer from asthma, as an inhaler was shown among the things Cartman claims in "Sexual
                        Harassment Panda", although this was never mentioned in the series again.</p>

                    <p>Stan is an avid animal lover - he gets a dog in "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". He resists the
                        influence of his uncle Jimbo to hunt in "Volcano" (he mentions this in "Death"), became a
                        P.E.T.A.
                        member in "Douche and Turd" (although he had the choice of joining them or being killed), tried
                        to
                        save baby cows in "Fun with Veal", and attempted to return a goat to its rightful owners in
                        "Osama
                        bin Laden Has Farty Pants". Although well-intentioned, these interventions often lead him and
                        his
                        friends into serious trouble. Stan (as well as the rest of the boys from 4th grade) also went to
                        Mexico and managed to get the Mexican Space Program to take an orca to the moon in a bid to save
                        it
                        (with all the kids in South Park having been led to believe he was a killer whale from the moon)
                        in
                        "Free Willzyx". In "Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow", after he and Cartman crash a boat
                        into
                        a beaver dam and swim to shore, seeing the boat blow up, Stan says, "I hope we didn't hurt any
                        beavers." In "Fun with Veal" he briefly turned to vegetarianism, but he quickly gave it up when
                        he
                        was plagued by a disease that literally "turned him into a pussy", sprouting actual vaginas on
                        his
                        body, a disease called Vaginitis. He also sets out to save the whales and dolphins from the
                        Japanese
                        in "Whale Whores". It is revealed in "Rainforest Shmainforest" that he is afraid of snakes.</p>

                    <p>Stan is shown to sympathize with others, most evidently seen in "ManBearPig", in which he
                        partially
                        defends Al Gore because he feels sorry for him, due to him "not having any friends". However,
                        when
                        this pity backfires and lands him in a cave where Al Gore almost (unintentionally) drowns him,
                        Kyle,
                        Cartman, and Kenny, he lashes out and brings Al Gore into a cold, hard reality, shouting, "Stay
                        away
                        from us, asshole! I only felt sorry for you because you didn't have any friends! But now I know
                        why
                        you don't have any friends! You just use Manbearpig as a way of getting attention for yourself
                        because you're a loser!" This does not affect Al Gore, however, as he dons a cape and says he
                        will
                        go and make a movie starring himself (An Inconvenient Truth). Ironically, Al Gore is also
                        responsible for the deaths of Stan and everyone else in "Imaginationland, Episode III", even
                        though
                        they were revived by Butters.</p>

                    <img src="../img/characters/stan_marsh/stan_engry.webp"
                        class="stan-image-engry img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Stan Marsh engry image">

                    <p>When angered, Stan is often quite reluctant to continue/do anything that will further contribute
                        to
                        the obscurity or direness of the situation. This is shown in "Woodland Critter Christmas" after
                        he
                        finds out the Critters, whom he helped, were giving birth to the Anti-Christ, he decided not to
                        attempt to set things right (although did eventually after much nagging from the episode's
                        narrator)
                        also in this episode, we found out that Stan was a Christian. Technically, though, this was not
                        him
                        - just a fictional version of him created by Eric Cartman for his Christmas story. For the first
                        seven seasons of the show, Stan's sporadic girlfriend was Wendy Testaburger. In the early days
                        of
                        the series, a running gag would be that Stan would throw up out of nervousness whenever Wendy
                        spoke
                        to him. As the show progressed, however, the Stan-Wendy storyline diminished greatly. In the
                        penultimate episode of the seventh season, "Raisins", Wendy had Bebe tell Stan that "she breaks
                        up",
                        for Tolkien, causing Stan to go into extreme depression and join the Goth Kids. He recovered,
                        thanks
                        to Butters, who was dealing with his own heartbreak and had decided that he would rather be "a
                        crying little pussy than a faggy goth kid". Stan eventually got over the break-up by telling
                        Wendy
                        "you're a bitch" and giving Tolkien the middle finger while saying "Tolkien, right here, buddy".
                        Wendy has played a much smaller part in the series since this episode. It became apparent that
                        Stan
                        had some lingering feelings for Wendy in "Follow That Egg!" when he grew insanely jealous of
                        Kyle
                        working with her. He, however, decided to show her up by responding to her compliments with "as
                        if I
                        give a crap about what you think, Wendy". At the end of "The List", however, Stan and Wendy
                        reconciled. They inadvertently have an adventure together, and at the end, Wendy admits to
                        having a
                        good time with Stan and believes he has changed since they were last together. They lean in to
                        kiss,
                        but in a near-exact copy of a scene at the end of "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", Stan pukes on
                        Wendy.
                        Their status as boyfriend and girlfriend is affirmed in "Super Fun Time". Also, in the Season
                        Thirteen episode, "Butters' Bottom Bitch", Butters tries to get Wendy to work for him in his
                        "Kissing Company" referring to her as a "bitch" and Stan says "Butters, Dude, you can't call my
                        girlfriend a bitch" and threatens to hurt him if he continues. Stan is shown to be a bully at
                        times
                        when he and Cartman mention that they sat on a kid and farted on him. He and Cartman also beat
                        up a
                        random third grader when they enter fourth grade. He also threatens Butters for attempting to
                        steal
                        the video from him in "The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers" while trying
                        to
                        get to the video store.</p>

                    <p>Stan is frequently embarrassed or infuriated at the stupidity of his parents and the other adults
                        of
                        the town, and he often goes against what his parents do. This is prominently shown in "My Future
                        Self n' Me" when he finds out about the actor portraying his future self and goes so far as to
                        trick
                        Randy to cut the hand off of the actor to try and get them to admit they lied. In "Child
                        Abduction
                        is Not Funny", the escalating paranoia over child abductions leads the parents to send all the
                        town's children away, in fear that they (the parents) will abduct their own kids. As the
                        children
                        wander off on their own, Stan remarks to Kyle, "Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really
                        stupid," and as they rejoin their families at the conclusion of the episode, "Jesus Christ,
                        dude,
                        they've done some stupid crap before, but, Jesus Christ....." In "Two Days Before the Day After
                        Tomorrow" he admits to breaking a beaver dam, and the adults assume that this was instead a
                        message
                        urging them not to waste energy on pointing the finger of blame. After several failed attempts
                        to
                        explain that it actually was him who broke the dam through everyone saying "I broke the dam", he
                        shouted, "I BROKE THE FUCKING DAM!" and explained the exact sequence of events without any
                        effect on
                        the adults. The rather displaced cynicism that he exhibits when dealing with adults, as well as
                        his
                        inability to be impressed by celebrities or fads may also come from the fact that, due to his
                        parents, he has probably never respected or trusted adults. Also in "Crème Fraiche", he says
                        "You
                        guys, my dad is retarded but he is not that retarded" when Cartman presents his idea to Stan on
                        how
                        to trick Randy into not wanting to cook.</p>

                    <p>In "Trapped in the Closet", Stan was thought to be the leader of Scientology having scored the
                        highest thetan levels since L. Ron Hubbard and was quickly approached by Tom Cruise, whom Stan
                        called an average actor. After hearing this Tom Cruise shouted, "I'm a failure in the eyes of
                        the
                        prophet!" and locked himself in Stan's closet. After unsuccessfully attempting to get him out,
                        Stan
                        shouts down the stairs to Randy, "DAD! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!" (which is a
                        reference to the rumors that Tom Cruise was gay, with "coming out of the closet" meaning when a
                        gay
                        man admits he is gay). Stan is later told that Scientology is fake and that if he writes
                        anything
                        almost everyone would believe it and he could make up to $3 million. Later on, when he reads his
                        new
                        writings to his loving public, his morality objected to it and he told everyone that Scientology
                        was
                        fake and that it was a wrong way to answer the many questions. Stan was then sued by almost
                        everyone, including Cruise and the head of the church, without anyone taking any action until he
                        lost his temper, shouting, "Well go on then! SUE ME!"</p>

                    <p>Stan is quite athletically proficient, and is regularly the captain or star player of his
                        school's sports teams, except in basketball where Kyle is the best player in the school, and
                        dodgeball where Pip Pirrip is the best player. He was the quarterback of the school football team in
                        "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". In baseball, Stan is seen hitting home runs and is the pitcher (though
                        this is rare in professional baseball) and apparent captain of South Park's team in "The Losing Edge". He
                        and the other boys also play baseball in "Child Abduction is Not Funny". He was also a
                        member of the South Park dodgeball team that won the world championship and was on the pee-wee hockey team
                        when he was 4 years old, revealed in "Stanley's Cup". Stan also coached a pee-wee hockey team
                        that episode and showed he quit from hockey after failing to win a hockey game for the team on a
                        'breakaway'. His favorite sports team, regarding the setting, Colorado, is the Denver Broncos. He also
                        manages to go from a beginner skier to a near-professional in only two days in "Asspen" (thanks to the timely
                        use of a montage). The episode ends with him successfully skiing the K-13, "the most dangerous run in
                        America", in order to beat a much older man who repeatedly insulted him and challenged him to the
                        run. He also tries out for the South Park wrestling team in "W.T.F.", but leaves after the coach
                        makes Butters do a "gay" move on Cartman. In the episode, he goes on to form a wrestling league with the
                        other boys.</p>

                <div id="Trivia">
                    <h4>Trivia</h4>

                    <li>Stan is the only one of the four who has never contracted a terminal illness, as both Kyle and
                        Cartman contracted AIDS in "Tonsil Trouble" and Kenny contracted muscular dystrophy in "Kenny
                        Dies". </li>

                    <li>Stan has been shown to be an animal rights activist: he protected baby calves from slaughter in "Fun
                        with Veal", joined PETA (though only to survive because if he did not do so, he would have starved
                        in the wilderness) in "Douche and Turd", and headed the Whale Wars crew for a while in "Whale Whores".</li>

                    <li>In episode "Make Love, Not Warcraft", the Warcraft executive tells Randy they need to get the sword
                        to a great knight, by the name of 'LUVS2SPWGE'.[4] However, at the start of the episode, when
                        viewing Stan's game screen you can read Stan's character name is "Staniscool".</li>

                    <li>Before Season Four, Stan was never seen without his hat, even when he was in bed.</li>

                    <li>Stan is the last one of the four boys to have a supernatural power at one point. Kyle has
                        disappeared and briefly became an omniscient being by studying existentialism in "The Tooth Fairy
                        Tats 2000". Cartman has the ability to see and hear ghosts, and the ability to fire electricity at
                        people in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Kenny has had the power of immortality throughout the
                        series. Stan obtains momentaneous powers, like flying, apparent telekinesis/superforce, and
                        projecting fire from hands and mouth, when Satan possesses him in order to fight Beelzaboot in
                        "Freemium Isn't Free".</li>

                    <li>Stan has said "Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here" on at least three Christmas specials: "Mr.
                        Hankey, the Christmas Poo", "Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!" and "Red Sleigh Down". He says these
                        when something strange happens. In "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", he says it when Mr. Hankey
                        appears. In "Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!", he says it when him and the others go to celebrate
                        Christmas with "Charlie Manson". And in "Red Sleigh Down", he says it when Jesus is shot by an
                        Iraqi.</li>

                    <li>Stan has a somewhat stronger digestive system than many others do as shown in "Dead Celebrities"
                        since he is able to eat at Chipotle without bleeding out his ass afterwards. Cartman even remarks
                        that Stan has a "golden rectum of the gods".</li>

                    <li>As of "201" Stan is the only one of the four boys who does not have a redheaded parent.</li>

                    <li>Stan is depicted as a jock by the goth kids in "Breast Cancer Show Ever".</li>

                    <li>Stan is the only one of the four boys not to have the "Oh my god, They killed..." quote about him.</li>
