                    <p>
                        <i class="character-name">Al Gore</i> was the 45th Vice President of the United
                        States under the Clinton administration from
                        1993 until 2001, and ran for president against George Bush in 2000. He is most notable within
                        the series for trying to alert people of ManBearPig, though he also appears once during his vice
                        presidency, and reappears later to sue the town.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Appearance</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Al Gore originally wore a generic black suit with a thin face and black hair. In Season Ten, his
                        new look included dark brown hair, a blueish gray shirt, and a brown tie. He later began wearing
                        a red cape. In Season Twenty-Two, his look has changed again, with his hair color now gray and
                        having grown a matching beard. He also wears his blueish gray shirt, dark pants, and bowling
                        shoes.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>

                    <hr />
                    <p>Gore appears to be very delusional and deranged, which is shown most when he apparently invents
                        the ManBearPig creature and puts the boys' lives in danger to maintain that fantasy. This might
                        be due to an obsessive need for everyone to admire him as per Stan's description, "You just use
                        ManBearPig to get attention for yourself because you're a loser!". This indicates that Gore has
                        an extreme case of egocentricity as his attention-seeking idée fixe has poisoned his mind to the
                        point that he undisputedly believes in the reality of ManBearPig.</p>

                    <p>Gore apparently made up ManBearPig and made it seem real (as far as he thought), so that the
                        world would consider him a hero for "destroying" it, which is all he cares about. His mental
                        creation manifested itself among the other evil characters of Imaginationland and he was willing
                        to destroy Imaginationland along with all of its inhabitants to kill ManBearPig. Believing
                        himself a super-hero of sorts, after donning his cape he began running around acting and talking
                        like Superman. However, ManBearPig was proven to be real in "Time To Get Cereal" where it goes
                        on a rampage in South Park.</p>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Aslan the Lion</i> is a character from The Chronicles of Narnia. In
                        South Park, he appears as the
                        leader of the Council of Nine in the "Imaginationland" trilogy, as well as the leader of the
                        lions at the zoo in "Here Comes the Neighborhood". In "Imaginationland", he scares Butters
                        Stotch into using his "Key" powers to revive Santa Claus, and later other good characters, so
                        the good creatures could defeat the evil characters.</p>

                    <h6>Appearance</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>In "Here Comes the Neighborhood", he looks like a regular lion, with brown fur and a large mane.
                        However, in "Imaginationland", he appears more realistic and has green emerald eyes.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>In "Here Comes the Neighborhood", he seems to have a huge sense of humor, even laughing at every
                        joke he hears. In "Imaginationland", his sense of humor is largely gone, replaced by a more
                        serious, commanding attitude.</p>

                    <h4>Asian girls</h4>

                    <p> <i class="character-name">The Asian Girls</i> are a clique of new students at South Park
                        Elementary who are usually seen
                        sitting on the steps just inside the main entrance to the school, drawing art, particularly
                        Yaoi. They were formally introduced in the Season Nineteen episode, "Tweek x Craig", but a few
                        of them are also seen in "Safe Space". They have since become background characters.</p>

                    <p>There are other Asian-American female students at the school, such as Liza Nelson, who are not
                        considered part of his clique.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>The Asian Girls are a specific clique consisting of several girls with at least Japanese, Korean,
                        and Chinese heritage, including Lisa Akimoto, Kelly Zhou and Heather Nishimura. They tend to be
                        quiet and keep to themselves, responding to outside events through their art rather than direct
                        action, and sometimes conversing in their native dialects. They all appear to be artists. Many
                        of them also sell their works to others behind Whole Foods in CtPaTown.</p>

                    <p>During "Tweek x Craig", the Asian Girls draw pictures of Tweek and Craig together in a fictitious
                        homosexual relationship, starting a rumor that the two are dating. Wendy Testaburger holds a
                        presentation for the school featuring their art, drawing much attention to them and the rumor,

                    <p>Baahir has olive skin and curly, black hair, that is shaved around the sides. He wears a
                        sky-blue, button-up shirt and dark gray trousers.</p>

                    <p>He was portrayed as nice and slightly over-trusting, even befriending Butters Stotch and going to
                        his house, despite only knowing Butters for a few hours.</p>
                    <p>Baahir's parents, Mr. Hakeem and Mrs. Hakeem, were kidnapped by Cartman when he was trying to
                        find out the location of their son. He then tortured them by farting in their faces. When they
                        refused to respond, professing that they did not know where Baahir was, Cartman then injected
                        his arm with a syringe full of apple juice, warning them that apple juice gives him "super bad
                        farts". He left them tied up and imprisoned after he found out that Baahir was at Butters'
                        house. Due to their abominable experiences in South Park, the Hakeems moved away at the end of
                        the episode. Cartman rejoiced at this, saying that not only did his bigotry save the country
                        from the real terrorist attacks, but it also got rid of the Muslim family.</p>

                        for Butters taking Kenny's place on the show. The episode, titled "Butters' Very Own Episode",
                        gave Butters a complicated back story where his father was outed as being a closet bisexual and
                        his mother attempted to drown her son Butters in a fit of madness. They all made up at the end
                        of the episode and nothing came of it.</p>

                    <p>Butters found himself as the new fourth friend, being put down and treated like a total outcast
                        by his new friends. Kyle, Stan, and Cartman all openly bullied Butters, telling him how he is
                        not cool like Kenny. Cartman in particular took perverse pleasure in making Butters suffer, to
                        the extent that, in "Jared Has Aides", he pretended to be Butters on the phone and bad-mouthed
                        his parents, just so he could watch them abusing him. Several instances show the boys having
                        Butters dress up as Kenny or simply call him Kenny or Not-Kenny, possibly to cope with their
                        loss.</p>

                    <p>Butters would remain on as the fourth member of the gang for four more episodes; two of the
                        episodes continued the plot of Butters being abused but downplayed it and in the case of "Freak
                        Strike", ending the episode just as Butters was about to be beaten (with Cartman being beaten up
                        instead). Ultimately, in the sixth episode of season six, "Professor Chaos", Butters is expelled
                        from the group for being "too lame" and adopts his super-villain alter ego "Professor Chaos" as
                        a means to get revenge against the group and society for rejecting him. Butters would run around
                        for several episodes as Professor Chaos, only to have no one care much about his plots since
                        many of them had, though Butters did not realize it, already occurred on episodes of the
                        animated series The Simpsons. Butters would eventually reveal his secret identity of Professor
                        Chaos to Stan, although he mistook it for Butters coming out of the closet.</p>

                    <p>Though not anymore a member of the main four's group, Butters was nevertheless kept as a
                        prominent member of the boys' extended circle. Though he has returned, Kenny's role has declined
                        to an extent due to lack of ideas for the character and Butters has taken on a more prominent
                        role again. Despite their ill-treatment toward him, Butters stays loyal to his friends, perhaps
                        in hopes that they will accept him. In a way, this has worked as recently there seems to have
                        been some shift in the balance of friendship. The most obvious case of this being in "Tsst",
                        where Butters is calmly playing along with Stan, Kyle and Kenny, with Cartman being much more
                        alienated than usual, as well as in "Casa Bonita", where Kyle decides to take Butters with him
                        on his birthday to Casa Bonita instead of Cartman, implying he likes Butters more than Cartman.
                        It has been said that Kyle despises Cartman because of his cruel, sadistic and selfish
                        attitudes, as well as his prejudice—especially towards the Jews.</p>

                    <p>Despite their history, Butters has recently taken on the role as Cartman's sidekick. Cartman
                        often takes advantage of Butters' kindness and desire to be accepted in order to fulfill his
                        schemes. Cartman hurts and betrays Butters quite often, however, Butters continues to trust him
                        unconditionally. Despite this, Butters got even in "AWESOM-O", where he filmed Cartman dancing,
                        dressed up as Britney Spears, later showing it to South Park Elementary's various students and
                        faculty.</p>

                    <p>Butters is also a very famous celebrity in the nation of Mexico. In "The Last of the Meheecans",
                        Butters accidentally strays from Cartman's house and almost gets run over by a car. He is then
                        "refuged" in a house by a couple who thinks that Butters is a Mexican and is given the name
                        "Mantequilla", which is Spanish for Butter. They make him into their personal slave and then
                        dump him into an El Pollo Loco restaurant. Butters then goes with some Mexicans and crosses into
                        Mexico where he becomes a symbol of patriotism to the Mexicans. Butters realizes his popularity
                        in Mexico when he comes outside naked in front of hundreds of Mexicans. He realizes that every
                        time he raises his arms, the Mexicans cheer with joy. Butters is then made a fugitive by Cartman
                        but the U.S Border Patrol lets Butters back in and win the game of Texans vs. Mexicans. He is
                        allowed back into the U.S and shows his popularity to the other boys. In addition, he did not
                        get grounded by his parents for becoming famous in a foreign country despite being gone for more
                        than 2 weeks.</p>

                        who is the only person who can see him. He first appears in the Season Sixteen episode "Cartman

                        class="image-style-options-1 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Cupid Cartman image">

                    <p>In "Cartman Finds Love", Cartman, who thinks black people belong together, plans to set up
                        Tolkien and Nichole in a relationship, by having them locked alone in the school gymnasium
                        overnight. After the two are rescued, Cartman secretly watches them, as they decide to pursue
                        the relationship. At that time, Cupid Cartman appears next to Cartman and they congratulate each
                        other.</p>

                    <p>When Tolkien and Nichole break up due to a misunderstanding, Cartman loses faith in Cupid Cartman
                        and beats him with a bat. Later, after watching a laxative commercial, which suggests "you have
                        to push even harder", he decides to apologize to Cupid Cartman and tries to get Tolkien and
                        Nichole back together again. After he succeeds in his plan, Cupid Cartman tells him he found a
                        girl for him too. When asked who she was, Cupid Cartman points to Stacy Muleburg, the Halitosis
                        Kidz! kid, much to Cartman's horror.</p>

                    <p>In "Tweek x Craig", Cartman attempts to use Cupid Cartman to bring Tweek and Craig together.
                        Cupid Cartman goes to Craig and shoots him with an arrow, as well as peeing in his mouth.
                        Afterwards, Cupid Cartman attempts to flirt with Cartman, who denies his advances because he
                        isn't gay.</p>

                    <p>Late in the episode, when Tweek and Craig "break up", Cartman asks Cupid Cartman to make things
                        right again, but he refuses to do so unless Cartman goes on a date with him. Cartman reluctantly
                        agrees and Cupid Cartman shoots Craig's dad with an arrow (and pees in his mouth) to get him to
                        accept Craig's "situation". At the end of the episode, Cupid Cartman gives Cartman a massage on
                        their date, which Cartman doesn't enjoy. He follows this by having anal sex with Cartman. This
                        all happens in Cartman's imagination, though, as in the next scene it is revealed he is actually
                        masturbating in the bathroom, as his mother watches.</p>

                    <img src="../img/characters/minor_characters/craig_tucker.webp"
                        class="image-style-options-1 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Craig Tucker image">

                    <p><i class="character-name">Craig Tucker</i> is a member of the boys' fourth-grade class. Craig's
                        most distinguishing physical
                        feature is his blue chullo hat topped with a yellow puffball. One of his traits is his
                        compulsive tendency to flip people off, usually for no discernible reason. He leads the group
                        known as Craig's Gang. He is one of the two children (along with Tweek Tweak) who are openly
                        gay.</p>

                    <p>While eight years old in the first three seasons, he was nine years old by "Fourth Grade", and as
                        of the Season Twelve episode "Pandemic 2: The Startling", he is ten years old, according to the
                        candles on his birthday cake. He also speaks with a rather deep voice, which is unusual for a
                        child at his age.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Craig seems to be the most stoic, cynical, apathetic, and deadpan kid in South Park, having a
                        more abrasive personality than the rest of the characters, a trait exaggerated by his
                        deeper-than-average voice. He has been described as pragmatic, monotone, and sarcastic. He also
                        appears to be more logical and mature than some of his peers, typically being the one to call
                        them out on their ignorance. He generally prefers to be left alone, harboring very few but
                        simple interests. In the making of South Park: The Fractured But Whole, it was written on a
                        whiteboard that he only cares about his guinea pig, and his boyfriend, Tweek.</p>

                    <p>Craig is implied to have bad behavior, and is referred to as "the biggest trouble-maker" in his
                        class by Eric Cartman in "Tweek vs. Craig". Craig has a habit of flipping people off, sometimes
                        to express irritation, anger, or disdain towards them, sometimes as a reflex. This is a trait
                        the official South Park website states is learned from his family,[3] who are all seen flipping
                        each other off in "Tweek vs. Craig". His habit of flipping people off has been shown much less
                        in later episodes, although a later incident regarding flipping off the principal of school
                        ended up with him in detention, and it is part of one of his abilities in South Park: The
                        Fractured But Whole.</p>

                    <p>The last time in the main series where he is seen making the gesture is "Fun with Veal", where he
                        and his parents are filmed by a cameraman, who gives them an interview. His parents are worried
                        and talk about a serious event that occurs in town, as Craig just remains blank-faced and flips
                        off the people who watch them on TV.</p>

                    <p>Due to his bad behavior, he is frequently sent to Mr. Mackey's office. Scenes involving a
                        character visiting Mr. Mackey's office will often show Craig sitting in the waiting seats
                        outside the door. Craig's most notable interview with Mr. Mackey was in "Rainforest
                        Shmainforest", where he flipped Mr. Mackey off several times and was sent to wait outside the
                        office again.</p>

                    <p>In earlier episodes, Craig normally has a blank face - even when flipping people off. This is
                        seen most predominantly in "Tweek vs. Craig" when he randomly flips off his entire family while
                        remaining a completely straight face. If his face is not blank, he is frowning for one reason or
                        another.</p>

                    <p>Although all the kids are violent, to an extent, Craig is shown to be the second most violent,
                        after Cartman, since he seems to be the primary initiator of several of the more severe
                        incidents of bullying that occurred at the school (e.g. Mark Cotswolds' duct-taping).</p>

                    <p>Craig is also shown to be one of the most skilled fighters in the class, shown beating up Mark
                        Cotswolds, attacking Kyle when Kyle chooses not to dress like a metrosexual, attacking Kenny
                        when Cartman frames him for having lice and beating up several Ginger Kids after Cartman's
                        speech. Contrarily, in "Tweek vs. Craig", he appears to have no idea how to fight at all and has
                        to take lessons in sumo wrestling. He wields a katana in "Good Times with Weapons" as well. And
                        in "Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society", he manages to knock both Tolkien and Butters unconscious
                        before being knocked out by Stan, when he uses a bone as a club to strike him.</p>

                    <img src="../img/characters/minor_characters/craig_tucker_2.webp"
                        class="craig-tucker-2-image img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Second Craig Tucker image">

                    <p>Later, his negative traits are subdued, as he is inclined to remain passive and stoical to
                        everything that happens around him. An early expression of this is displayed in "Red Hot
                        Catholic Love", in which he approaches his classmates in the bathroom and asks what was going
                        on. They tell him they are waiting for Cartman to defecate through his mouth. He only answers
                        "Oh" and leaves immediately.</p>

                    <p>During the "Pandemic" episodes, he makes remarks about Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny and their
                        habit of getting into trouble - he even walks away from them when they want to go deeper into an
                        Inca temple. However, at the end of the episode after he accidentally walks on the platform and
                        stopped the "Guinea Pirate", he simply lets out a deep sigh and accepts his fate. Craig never
                        once registers shock or any emotion whatsoever during this - he always says things flatly and
                        monotonously, even when he says "Okay. Now there's sparks shooting out of my eyes."</p>

                    <p>Craig has notable leadership skills, as he is the leader of a gang who is social rivals with
                        Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny. The first appearance of the group is in "Tweek vs. Craig", and
                        they are first acknowledged by the main characters in "How to Eat with Your Butt". The main
                        characters are first shown viewing Craig's gang as rivals in "South Park is Gay!". Cartman
                        refers to the gang as "Craig and those guys". The group usually consists of Craig, Clyde,
                        Tolkien, and sometimes Tweek, Jimmy, or Jason. Craig and Clyde seem to share/alternate in the
                        leadership of their group, although, given their designation, Craig is the primary leader.</p>

                    <p>Another example of Craig's abilities in leadership occurs in "Hooked on Monkey Fonics" when he
                        leads the male students in their plan to harm Mark Cotswolds. The episode also shows that his
                        assertiveness can also lead to bullying.</p>

                    <p>Craig competes more with the main characters than even the rest of his gang (see below). In
                        "Quest for Ratings", he opens a television show in the school entitled "Animals Close-Up With a
                        Wide-Angle Lens", which rivals their news show. However, he seems quite eager to help them at
                        other times, as in "Free Willzyx", in which he is one of the boys trying to get the orca back to
                        its "home" on the moon. Nonetheless, he rarely hangs out with the boys by himself, he is only
                        seen with them when the rest of Craig's gang is there.</p>

                    <p>In "Pandemic", Stan and Kyle's parents decide that they do not want Craig to hang around with
                        them since they had gone missing shortly after he joined the usual quartet. They deem him a
                        "troublemaker", although the Peruvian flute band was the others' idea, and Craig refused to join
                        them until he was told, "don't be an asshole."</p>

                        went on to critical acclaim as well as controversy.</p>

                    <p>Caitlyn Jenner was first mentioned in "Stunning and Brave" when PC Principal reprimands and sends
                        Kyle to detention for saying she is not a hero. Later on in the episode, Kyle takes back this
                        statement in desperation to stop Cartman's attack on the PC house and to stop being targeted by
                        PC Principal and Randy Marsh.</p>

                    <p>In "Where My Country Gone?", Kyle meets Jenner during a speech given by Obama celebrating Kyle's
                        newfound tolerance speech. Obama surprises Kyle during the speech, saying that he'll get to ride
                        back to South Park "by his hero." As they leave the White House, Jenner carelessly runs over and
                        kills a pedestrian. At the end of the episode, Mr. Garrison announces his candidacy for
                        president, and announces Caitlyn Jenner as his running mate, meaning that Caitlyn Jenner was a
                        Mr. Garrison supporter. Much like before, she and Garrison drive away, only for her to hit and
                        kill a pedestrian as they leave.</p>

                    <p>Caitlyn reappears in "Sponsored Content" where she aids Mr. Garrison in his debate against
                        Hillary Clinton. She steps in during the debate to say that Hillary looks like a donkey took a
                        shit on her face. After hearing about the conspiracy in South Park, she later drives Mr.
                        Garrison and Principal Victoria back to South Park. Much like before, she winds hitting and
                        killing a pedestrian along the way. This time, she runs over an entire crowd of people.</p>

                    <p>In "Truth and Advertising", they are shocked to see what has happened to the town since they
                        left. She assists Mr. Garrison and Principal Victoria in an attack against the PC Bros.</p>

                    <h4>Carol McCormick</h4>

                    <p> <i class="character-name">Carol McCormick</i> is the wife to Stuart McCormick, as well as the
                        mother of Kenny, Kevin, and
                        Karen. She first appeared in the Season One episode, "Starvin' Marvin".</p>

                    <h6>Appearance</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <img src="../img/characters/minor_characters/Carol.webp"
                        class="image-style-options-2 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Carol McCormick image">

                    <p>Carol wears a lime-green T-shirt which usually reads "I'm with Stupid", and dark blue jeans. The
                        arrow is supposed to point at Stuart, but she is usually standing on the wrong side of him, so
                        it points off in some other direction. Her hair is red, and similar in style to Red's, but her
                        bangs go in the same direction as Wendy Testaburger's. She has a shadowy patch on her right
                        cheek, which may be a bruise, or simply filth.</p>

                    <p>In "Cartman Joins NAMBLA", her shirt had an American flag embroidered on it, accompanied by the
                        phrase "God Bless". When the McCormick's went on the John Denver experience, however, it
                        appeared as a solid green T-shirt. In "Best Friends Forever", it is a solid, but darker green.
                    </p>

                    <p>For special occasions, she wears a fake fur coat with a red crop top underneath and a red
                        miniskirt, but as of Season Twelve she would wear a dark green blouse and a long gray skirt. At
                        events such as funerals, she wears a much more black fancy shirt and dress with a veil.</p>

                    <p>At night, she wears a nightshirt with several bunnies on it and pajama pants.</p>

                    <p>As of "The Ring", like many other adults, her appearance has been cleaned up, including small
                        subtle changes to her hairstyle, T-shirt, arms and pants. Her arms have been straightened, the
                        shirt is no longer angled, and her hair now has fine detail.</p>

                    <p>In South Park: Post Covid, Carol appears as an elderly woman. She is visibly aged, has gained
                        some weight, and wears a dark green sweater with a large stripe design. Her hair remains similar
                        to the hairstyle she had when she was younger, albeit greying.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>She and her husband Stuart McCormick are prone to excessive drinking, and often fight and bicker
                        with one another. Carol often claims that if Stuart would stop drinking and being lazy, and get
                        a job, they might not be so hungry and poor. Their fighting often escalates to physical beating,
                        and she once gave him a black eye. She seems to have quite some strength, seeing as when she
                        hits Stuart as well as when she tackled Gerald Broflovski to the ground in "I'm a Little Bit
                        Country". Carol does care for Stuart deep down, though, as she was concerned for him when he
                        went ill after consuming a drink mixed with abortion medication, got his nose broken on the John
                        Denver experience, and was molested by the entire NAMBLA Society in "Cartman Joins NAMBLA".</p>

                    <p>However, she also seems to think that the McCormick residence primarily belongs to her, as in
                        "Chickenlover", she says (regarding Stuart): "I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit!
                        He can't even hold a fuckin' job!" and yells a similar phrase at him in "Best Friends Forever".
                        However, Stuart and Gerald built that same house when they were teenagers, as revealed in
                        "Chickenpox".</p>

                    <p>She speaks with a thick Southern accent, a trait passed on to her eldest son.</p>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Christophe</i>, also known as The Mole, is a bitter French nine year
                        old with an expertise in covert
                        operations and an intense hatred of God. He appeared in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.</p>

                    <p>In South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Gregory told the boys to procure the Mole's help in saving
                        Terrance and Phillip. The Mole helps the boys infiltrate the USO show, but the mission fails
                        after Cartman forgets to shut down the base's security system. As a result, the Mole is fatally
                        injured by a group of army attack dogs.</p>

                    <p>As he died, he sang "The Mole's Reprise", while Kyle held him and softly eased him into death. At
                        his moment of passing away, The Mole continued his pattern of hatred towards God. The Mole, like
                        everyone else who died in the war, was presumably brought back to life after Kenny McCormick's
                        wish to Satan.</p>

                    <p>He made a brief cameo appearance in "Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub", where he is seen on Late Night
                        with Conan O'Brien, while Stan channel surfs.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>The Mole smokes cigarettes, is foul-mouthed, and has an outspoken grudge against God, whom he
                        blames for everything wrong with the world. He displays a tough exterior and appears to have a
                        jaded outlook, as well as being abrasive towards others. He also appears to be manic and
                        emotionally unstable. He also expresses a hatred for guard dogs. His character is influenced by
                        Grantaire from Les Misérables, just as Gregory is similar to Enjolras, although his song, "The
                        Mole's Reprise" also parallels Éponine's "A Little Fall of Rain". Despite his abrasive
                        personality, he still has an immature side to him as shown where he is seen playing with a
                        View-Master using them as binoculars.</p>

                        later by Trey Parker. He claims
                        to be from the seventh layer of hell. His only two speaking appearances to date were in the
                        eponymous episode "Damien" and in South Park: The Stick of Truth.</p>

                    <p>In "Damien", he joins the boys' class as the new student at South Park Elementary. He introduces
                        himself as the son of Satan, a claim which is completely ignored by Mr. Garrison, despite his
                        obvious evil powers. Damien is rejected from sitting with the main characters during lunch, and
                        is taunted by Kenny and Stan. Outraged, he turns Kenny into a duck-billed platypus, then demands
                        to speak to Jesus.</p>

                    <p>Damien's father, Satan, challenges Jesus to a boxing match, and everyone in town switches their
                        bets to Satan, realizing Jesus doesn't even stand a chance. One bet on Jesus remains, secretly
                        placed by Satan himself. Initially, Jesus is horribly beaten, but Satan throws the fight,
                        allowing Jesus to win in order to get everyone's money. Damien then returns to Hell alongside
                        his father, claiming that he only performs evil because he has to. As Damien leaves, Stan and
                        Kyle briefly lament that he will never be able to gain acceptance because he's always on the
                        move.</p>

                    <p>Since then, Damien has appeared in the background of various episodes. He was also seen in the
                        movie theater with other children watching Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire in South Park:
                        Bigger, Longer & Uncut.</p>

                    <h6>Interactions</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Damien befriends Pip Pirrip after being rejected by Cartman and the others. Though Damien doesn't
                        like Pip, the two are seen together throughout the episode. Pip shows empathy for Damien,
                        claiming that he "knows what it's like being the new kid". Following Pip's advice, Damien goes
                        into counseling with Mr. Mackey, who tells him to be passive and "overly nice". Damien tries
                        this with the boys, but is consequently farted on and called 'Fart Boy'. He tells Pip, who is
                        delighted at the thought of losing that nickname to Damien.</p>

                    <p>Damien and Pip were the only boys not invited to Cartman's birthday party. While sitting on the
                        street, Damien asks Pip if he has always been hated. Pip replies that he has, and that Cartman
                        is also hated, but is accepted by the others for teasing Pip. This gives Damien an idea. Damien
                        takes Pip to Cartman's party and as a gift, sends Pip flying in the air before making him
                        explode. Pip is then seen falling to the ground, where he lands safely in the snow, apparently
                        having enjoyed the experience. This wins Damien's acceptance, and he and Pip are never seen
                        together again.</p>

                    <p>In "Super Best Friends", Seaman explains that David Blaine was raised in New York City by a
                        decent family, but a freak washing machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of
                        the black arts. His magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand.</p>

                    <p>He is the leader of the suicide cult religion, "Blaintology" who views his magic tricks as holy
                        "miracles". He considers himself God, but the Super Best Friends halt the suicides and destroy
                        Blaine's giant Abraham Lincoln statue with their own giant John Wilkes Booth statue. Blaine

                        contribute to her death.</p>

                    <p>Her real cause of death is said to be unknown. However, this might be a mystification, since one
                        can easily deduce from the episode. Full explanation here.</p>

                    <p>After this incident, the students in Ms. Choksondik's class were given two weeks off school until
                        Mr. Mackey taught for a short period. In the episode "The Death Camp of Tolerance", Mr. Garrison
                        reprised his role as their teacher until he got fired again in "Where My Country Gone?".</p>

                    <hr />

                    <p>Ms. Choksondik is well known for her distinctive appearance; she has extremely exaggerated saggy
                        breasts, is overweight, and her right eye is lazy, causing it to drift downwards or wobble
                        around as she talks. She also does not wear a bra, so when she lifts her arm up, her shirt
                        stretches going up with it revealing her nipples. She also wears large glasses and was made fun
                        of in high school because of them.</p>

                    <p>Her outfit consists of a long red V-necked top with white cuffs and a white trim on the hem, and
                        a calf-length blue skirt that is possibly made of denim. She keeps her hair in a loose ponytail
                        held in place with a large white hair-tie and small golden loop earrings. She has a side fringe,
                        which is usually tucked behind her left ear (in fact, the only time it is seen loose is in
                        "Proper Condom Use" when she is having sex with Mr. Mackey). Also in "Proper Condom Use", she is
                        shown to be wearing large purple underpants with a frilly hem (the outline of which shows
                        through her skirt when she bends down). She has plain black shoes and appears to be wearing
                        white socks or tights, but when Mr. Mackey removes her clothes during "Proper Condom Use" it
                        appears that she is not wearing anything on her feet. However, this may be a continuity error.

                    <p>Early in life, Shwaggins was frequently teased for being short in stature. His mother had
                        dwarfism and his father had "gigantism", and she believed the two would produce a child of
                        average height.</p>

                    <p>Although he did not appear on screen, in "The Damned", he leaves a cryptic note on Gerald
                        Broflovski's car while he is in the supermarket. The note reads "I know who you are." After
                        Gerald initiates "Protocol Zero", he rushes home to destroy his computer. Forgetting that Ike's
                        computer may also contain information about his misdeeds as Skankhunt42, Gerald frantically
                        looks through it. He then receives a Google Alert saying the following:</p>

                    <blockquote class="episodes-title">meet me under the freemont bridge. 9am tomorrow.</blockquote>

                    <p>The next day, in "Wieners Out", Gerald meets Shwaggins under the bridge, as planned. Shwaggins
                        introduces himself as a fellow troll and tries to get Gerald to listen to some time-sensitive
                        information. Admiring Gerald's work as a troll, Shwaggins explains to Gerald that the Danish are
                        quickly planning to wipe out the trolls, and wants Gerald's help.</p>

                    <p>After stalking Gerald for several days, Dildo Shwaggins finally meets Gerald in the park and
                        shows him the video of Lennart Bedrager announcing TrollTrace.com, an internet service dedicated
                        to identifying users online. He then escorts Gerald to an undisclosed location, where a meeting
                        of fellow trolls, including Jenkins, is taking place.</p>

                    <p>In "Douche and a Danish", the meeting takes place, and Shwaggins successfully convinces Gerald
                        Broflovski to join their cause. Preparing for the big troll against Denmark, Shwaggins partners
                        with Broflovski at his home and sets up his computer in Gerald's office. The two, along with all
                        of the other trolls, successfully troll Denmark.</p>

                    <p>Believing he had a friendship with Gerald, he tries many unsuccessful times to grow their
                        friendship in "Fort Collins". He writes a song for Gerald, and even brings him a present. To no
                        avail, he finally learns that Gerald trolls just to be offensive, and gives up. Having given up,
                        he is unresponsive when Gerald attempts to contact him.</p>

                    <p>In "Oh, Jeez", he appears briefly along with the other trolls captured by TrollTrace.com.
                        Believing that Hillary Clinton had hired him to infiltrate and sabotage the service, he tours
                        the building in disguise. Lennart Bedrager secretly had a deal with Clinton to capture the
                        trolls, and locks Shwaggins and other trolls in a secure room.</p>

                    <p>Still captured in "Members Only", he tries to convince Gerald to stop trying to escape through
                        the security door. After Lennart Bedrager announces his plan for the world, Shwaggins declares
                        that President Garrison will not allow him to follow through with his plan.</p>

                        He made his debut appearance in
                        the Season Three episode, "Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub", where he was seen playing with Butters
                        Stotch, Pip Pirrip, and to a lesser extent, Stan Marsh. Originally in first grade, he advanced
                        to the second grade in the Season Four episode, "Fourth Grade". He often appears as Professor

                        Hot Tub". Much to Stan's chagrin, the former three start playing 'Wickershams and Ducklers'.
                        Dougie calls Stan a sourpuss for not joining in.</p>

                    <p>Moving on to playing Charlie's Angels, the four boys embark on a mission to leave the room
                        through an air vent Dougie finds. After their next mission, they watch a news report about the
                        ATF raiding Mackey's house. Dougie makes a video and Butters delivers it to a reporter, defusing
                        the situation.</p>

                    <p>In "Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000", Dougie is sledding at school with Pip, Tolkien, and Clyde.
                        Shortly after this, in "Fourth Grade", Dougie advanced from the first grade to the second grade.
                    </p>

                    <p>Butters is fired as the boys' fourth friend and becomes Professor Chaos in the eponymous episode.
                        Dougie joins the group of candidates auditioning to fill the role but is quickly eliminated
                        without having a proper chance.</p>

                    <p>He then learns of Butters' secret identity and becomes his sidekick as General Disarray. The two
                        try, unsuccessfully, to "destroy" the world by flooding it with a garden hose and by destroying
                        the ozone layer with aerosol spray cans.</p>

                    <p>In the episode "Professor Chaos", Dougie auditions to be the new fourth friend of the main
                        characters. He fails, though, and decides that he is an outcast. After discovering Butters'
                        secret alter-ego, Professor Chaos, he requests to join Butters in his attempts at world
                        demolition. Butters agrees, and dubs Dougie, "General Disarray". Their plots of flooding the
                        world with a garden hose, and then destroying the ozone layer with cans of aerosol spray
                        ultimately fail. Butters then tries to come up with various ideas, but Dougie tells him each
                        time that the Simpsons already did them.</p>

                    <p>Dougie often shows more willingness than Butters to go through with his "evil" plans when in his
                        alter-ego. This is showcased in the episode "The Coon", where he suggests betraying The Coon by
                        blowing him up alongside a hospital.</p>

                        PGA Tour 11 for Xbox 360, which is not so much a golf game as a two-player fighting game. In the
                        game, Elin goes around beating Tiger with a golf club for his many infidelities in assorted
                        venues such as their house, the golf course, and news conferences. The game is highly popular
                        among the boys, who find it far more entertaining than actual golf games.</p>

                    <p>Throughout the episode, numerous men, including Tiger Woods, attempt to make the claim that they
                        are not responsible for their sexual behavior, but rather that it's caused by something outside
                        their control, such as addiction. She later appears with Tiger during his press conference in
                        which he claims that he is 'cured' of his sex addiction (thanks to the death of the "Wizard
                        Alien" responsible), and that she now has no reason to get revenge on him by having affairs with

                        After Tiger Woods announced his having been "cured" of sexual addiction and his forthcoming
                        return to golf, it appeared that they were reconciled, though probably only in public. It should
                        be noted that in real-life, Elin divorced Woods in August 2010, several months after "Sexual
                        Healing" aired.</p>

                        and children and is horrified to discover that sex with children is apparently part of Vatican
                        Law. When he discovers this, he makes several attempts to change the "Holy Doctrine" so that sex
                        with children is wrong and suggests that priests be allowed to have sex with women.</p>

                    <p>His desire to change Vatican Law and be allowed to sleep with women may have something to do with
                        the fact that he has apparently had sex with several women in South Park, including Liane
                        Cartman.</p>

                    <p>There are also times where he seems to know very little about religion; once, when seeing Jesus
                        Christ, he exclaimed "Hey, it's that guy from the public access show!" However, considering that
                        Jesus actually hosts a cable access show in South Park, this is most likely done for irony
                        purposes.</p>

                    <p>He has his first major role in this episode. He expresses his beliefs on whether or not the
                        handicapped will go to Hell to the boys. They later see him having sex with a woman in the
                        church confessional, which gives Cartman the idea to lead his own Christian community.</p>

                        unearthed the massive corruption behind the many church-related sexual assaults. He also forced
                        the Catholic Church to stop letting priests molest young boys. Apparently, this plan almost
                        succeeds.</p>

                    <p>Father Maxi temporarily closes the church and becomes friends with Butters after the churchgoers
                        heckle him with pedophilia jokes. After Butters takes Maxi to Clyde's birthday party and the
                        children refuse to accept Maxi's presence, Maxi cuts ties with Butters, explaining he feels
                        guilt for knowing the Catholic Church were doing terrible things to boys and doing nothing about
                        it. However, when the Catholic Cleanup Crew kidnaps Butters, Stan, and Clyde, Maxi goes to save

                    <hr />

                    <p>His personality seems somewhat flexible based on the needs of the show; often he is a
                        narrow-minded and intolerant man who is convinced most people are going to be damned to Hell,
                        often for trivial offenses. For example, in "Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?" he states
                        constantly through his sermons that Hell awaits everyone in the town who does not go to church
                        and confess their sins.</p>

                    <p>Father Maxi is rude and disrespectful towards the beliefs of others, such as he when he tricks
                        Kyle, who is Jewish, into helping Stan and Cartman, into doing the Stations of the Cross. Also
                        in "Do the Handicapped Go to Hell?", he informs Kyle that because of his beliefs, he and his
                        family will go to Hell without question.</p>

                    <p>However, he still attempts to be a good priest and leader of the community. In "Red Hot Catholic
                        Love", it's revealed that he's the only priest not engaging in pedophilia. As a result, he
                        points out that they are to spread the word of God, not harm the innocent. He even goes to
                        Vatican City to stop this and nearly brings down the church as a result.</p>

                        clothes. He has short, soft black hair with a long side-swept fringe parted to the right, wears
                        dark purple lipstick and black eyeliner. He wears a black trench coat, black pants, and black
                        shoes.</p>

                    <p>As a conformist in "The Ungroundable", he wore a turquoise dress-shirt, khaki pants, and gray

                    <p>During the Attack the School quest in South Park: The Stick of Truth, he dresses up as a Viking.
                        He wears a brown Viking helmet (more different than Michael's and appears heavy), and a
                        green-silked cape.</p>

                    <p>When he reveals himself as an actual Emo in "Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers", the hair he had on
                        was just a toupee. He had his actual hair dyed magenta at the ends with a smaller fringe, a
                        dark-gray t-shirt with a gray skull and polka-dots, and some colorful bracelets.</p>

                    <p>In South Park: Post Covid, Firkle appears as an adult man, and is radically different from his
                        past form. Firkle seemingly was stopped adding make up to make his skin pale, because it its now
                        the most natural shade of the Goth Kids. In addition he still has a similar hair but with an
                        under buzzcut. He also has tear-like eye shadow, a brow piercing, sunken cheeks, and seemingly
                        has tattoos on his arms.</p>

                    <p>Funnybot appears in the episode of the same name, in which he served as the main antagonist.
                        After exhausting standard comedy routines, Funnybot decided to start slaughtering audiences to

                    <p>Future Butters came to the Stotch Residence four months before Stan's future self, Future Stan
                        did. Future Butters tells his family about how he abused alcohol, and now must take a medicine
                        to prevent liver failure. He also frequently watches a show called "Becker", much to the disdain

                    <p>Stan begins to put the pieces together when Butters tells him about Future Butters' coming. He

                    <p>In the supposed future painted by "Future Stan", after touching one marijuana joint, Stan's life
                        spiraled down into a self-destructive series of events in which he became hooked on assorted
                        drugs. He eventually ended up being sent to Juvenile Hall, during which he lost contact with his
                        childhood friends. He would later be released and spend the rest of his life living on the
                        streets, doing assorted and unspeakable things for drugs and booze. One night after falling
                        asleep behind a crack-house, he got stuck in a time-matrix and was transported back into his own
                        childhood. The Marsh family took him in upon his arrival.</p>

                    <p>In truth, "Future Stan" was nothing more than a professional stage actor associated with
                        Motivation Corp., a company created by people who felt that, rather than speak honestly with

                        dismal futures involving time-travel. Randy and Sharon hired Motivation Corp in hopes of doing
                        this with Stan. Determined to keep the lie going, Randy went as far as to cut off "Future
                        Stan's" hand when Stan pretended to cut his own hand off, possibly killing him.</p>

                        overweight. He wears similar clothes to Stan. He wears blue pants, a light blue shirt, and
                        Stan's trademark red poof-ball hat. As of the end of "My Future Self n' Me", Future Stan's actor
                        is missing a hand due to Randy calling Stan's bluff.</p>

                        friendly, outgoing, and optimistic. When he is teased and bullied by other students at school,
                        he does not appear to be bothered by it. For example, in "All About Mormons", Eric Cartman
                        introduces himself to Gary as "Ura Fag." Rather than acting upset or embarrassed, Gary laughs.
                        Later, when Stan threatens to “kick [his] ass,” Gary promises not to fight back and even hopes
                        that they can be friends someday.</p>

                    <p>Although he is friendly and forgiving, Gary is not a pushover. When Stan refuses to be Gary's
                        friend because of his religion, Gary responds with a very thoughtful speech about how proud he
                        is to be Mormon and what it has done for him. The speech ends with: "All I ever did was try to
                        be your friend, Stan. But you were so high and mighty that you couldn't just look past my
                        religion and be my friend back. You've got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls."</p>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Gerald Broflovski</i> is the husband of Sheila Broflovski and the
                        father of Kyle Broflovski and Ike
                        Broflovski. Operating under the alias of Skankhunt42, he plays a key antagonistic role
                        throughout Season Twenty. He is named after Matt Stone's late father, Gerald W. Stone.</p>

                    <p>He wears a magenta yarmulke, a khaki jacket with a blue shirt underneath as well as forest green
                        trousers. He has brown hair with sideburns and a full beard trimmed into a point at the chin and
                        shaved alongside the lips so that his mustache does not connect. On special occasions he is seen
                        wearing a variant of his casual clothes but they instead consist of several different tones of
                        black.</p>

                    <p>He has never been seen without his yarmulke on, except in "Major Boobage" which confirms that he
                        is balding, and in "Insecurity" where he is wearing a UPS driver cap instead of a yarmulke. The
                        fact that he is always seen wearing it would imply that he practices Orthodox Judaism, yet his
                        liberal views and the fact that no other Jewish clothes are worn by him or his family implies
                        that he is conservative or a member of a more progressive sect who wears it by choice.</p>

                    <p>He has been shown to have abundant chest hair; however, two hairless areas can be seen on it, one
                        on each chest, presumably being the result of his sexual encounters with Sheila.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Gerald seems to care about the environment and current events. He is typically portrayed to be
                        kind and friendly, though he can be stubborn, sarcastic and impolite at times. Although he is
                        seen as a primarily moral man, he is seen to get carried away with matters of money, which shows
                        him to be corruptible, tempting him to do things he would normally find amoral and wrong, much
                        to his shame.</p>

                    <p>In Season Twenty, his corruptible side is shown as he is revealed to be the infamous internet
                        troll known as Skankhunt42. He gleefully posts lewd and abysmal comments to young girls, and
                        women in general. He was visibly shocked when his trolling caused Freja Ollegard to commit
                        suicide, showing that he had no intentions of killing people. The source of this is that he
                        likes to harass just for the pleasure of humiliating others and to feel when he used to bully as
                        a kid.</p>

                    <h6>Trivia</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <li>With the exception of "Major Boobage", Gerald is always shown wearing his yarmulke hat, even
                        when he's otherwise completely naked like in "Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub" and "Not Funny".</li>

                    <li>Despite being named after Matt Stone's father, Gerald is not largely based on him. While Stone's
                        mother is Jewish, his father is a gentile of Irish descent, and Stone says they raised him in an
                        agnostic household. Stone decided to portray the character of Gerald as recognizably Jewish,
                        stating that doing so "creates more opportunity for comedy".</li>

                        the Season Thirteen episode,
                        "Ginger Kids". He was a 3rd grade student at South Park Elementary who was in charge of giving
                        the morning announcements, until his death in the episode "Dances with Smurfs".</p>

                    <p>In Gordon's first appearance in "Ginger Kids", he is among several discriminated redheads
                        participating in Cartman's pro-ginger rally. He plays a significant role throughout the episode,
                        being seen as a prominent follower of Cartman in the rally and giving a short talk at the
                        Airport Hilton before introducing Cartman to the gingers. In the end, when the gingers are about
                        to kill the non-redheaded kids, he is suspicious of Cartman's quick decision to change his plan
                        after seeing Kyle saying something privately to him. In this appearance, he is referred to as
                        "Jody".</p>

                    <p>The character was later used in "Fatbeard", where he is first seen reading the morning
                        announcements before being interrupted by Cartman and later getting kicked out of Cartman's
                        pirate crew for being red-haired.</p>

                    <p>Gordon makes his final appearance in "Dances with Smurfs", where he is gunned down during the
                        morning announcements by a man who mistakes him for a 40-year-old truck driver, who is having an
                        affair with his wife. This ends up causing the school body to do a memorial service for him and
                        ask for someone to replace him.</p>

                    <p>Despite Gordon's death, his character is still used as a prop in the crowd of gingers in "201".

                    <hr />

                    <p>George and Steven Spielberg seem to care more about changing their movies with new technology
                        over what the fans want in the original films.</p>

                    <p>George is portrayed as a rapist of his past in "Free Hat" by destroying his movies with updated
                        edits. Although when confronted by the boys, he is almost convinced to give up re-working his
                        movies, until Spielberg comes in and arrests the children.</p>

                    <p>In the episode, "The China Probrem", Lucas and Steven release their latest collaboration, Indiana
                        Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The general public is horrified by the film, feeling
                        that Lucas and Spielberg raped their beloved character, Indiana Jones. As a result, the boys
                        file a lawsuit against Lucas and Spielberg for "class-1 rape". When the police arrive to arrest
                        them, they find Lucas and Spielberg gang-raping a Star Wars Stormtr ooper, and later inform the
                        boys that they found the dead, raped bodies of Yoda and Short Round.</p>

                        Steven Spielberg later stated that editing E.T. was a huge mistake and vowed never to do such a
                        thing again, while Lucas has seen numerous edits made to the original trilogy since this episode
                        and has stated more may well occur.</li>

                        detective of the Park County

                        accompanied by his partner Mitch Murphy or generic police officers.</p>

                    <p>He first appears as a member of the FBI, but has since been seen as part of the Park County
                        Police, a role he has consistently kept in the series since then.</p>

                    <p>A police officer with a similar design to Yates appears working under Lieutenant Dawson in "Lil'
                        Crime Stoppers" as a background character.</p>

                    <p>In "Christian Rock Hard", he appears as a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
                        investigating illegal music downloads online, helping Stan, Kyle and Kenny realize that their
                        downloads are hurting musicians' careers</p>

                    <p>In "Casa Bonita" he appears at the Park County Police Force leading the investigation into
                        Butters Stotch's disappearance and is involving in pursuing Eric Cartman when his lies are
                        uncovered.</p>

                    <p>The character received his formal introduction in "The Jeffersons", where he is first depicted
                        unambiguously as the lead detective in the Park County Police Force, mentioning having served
                        for twenty-five years, with his name being used for the first time, his partner Mitch and his
                        wife Maggie also being introduced. After Michael Jackson (also known as Mr. Jefferson) moves
                        into South Park, he and the other detectives try to frame him as the file claims he is a wealthy
                        black man. He then panics and becomes disillusioned when he sees Jefferson, believing him to be
                        white, and is concerned he may have sent an innocent man to jail who was not black. After a pep
                        talk from his wife, he resumes his investigation, but when Jefferson decides to give away all of
                        his money, Yates lets him go, having no need to put another poor black man in jail.</p>

                    <p>In "Cartman's Incredible Gift", when a serial killer strikes South Park, Yates is desperate for
                        answers and begins turning to psychics. He becomes convinced that Cartman has psychic powers
                        that can capture the killer and dismisses proven science such as fingerprinting and blood
                        analysis as "Hocus Pocus". As a result, he arrests and even kills a number of innocent people
                        based on Cartman's alleged "psychic visions", failing to identify the killer as such when he
                        first investigates him, despite an overabundance of evidence. He does ultimately put this aside
                        and use 'good old fashioned police work' to help apprehend the Left Hand Killer.</p>

                    <p>In "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy", Kyle reports to Yates and the cops that the Kindergarten teacher,
                        Ms. Stevenson, is in a relationship with his younger brother, Ike. It is shown that Yates and
                        his pals, like all the other men in South Park do not see anything wrong with women committing
                        sex crimes like this one. At one point he remarked that he would have gladly hooked up with a
                        sexed-up teacher when he was a kid, again proving to be more of a hindrance than anything else
                        to the case.</p>

                    <p>In "Butters' Bottom Bitch", he went undercover as a prostitute after learning of an increase in
                        South Park prostitutes. Though it was obvious when he was a man in drag (he retained his male
                        sexual organs, his mustache, and his hairy body), no one seemed to notice this or at least chose
                        to ignore it. He also is unaware of the fact he doesn't need to have sex with the Johns to
                        arrest them for soliciting prostitution, something that creeps out the rest of his squad. He
                        seems to take his role so seriously that he not only has sex with his Johns, he also is involved
                        in a bareback gang-bang with dozens of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity men at the college, and he
                        also "falls in love" with his pimp, runs off to Switzerland, is married for a year before at
                        last arresting him.</p>

                    <p>In "The Coon", Yates is the primary police officer approached by Cartman in the guise of the
                        Coon. While he seems to see the Coon as an annoyance and tells him to leave, Yates praises the
                        assistance and work of the town's other hero, Mysterion, despite neither hero doing much to
                        assist the police force themselves and the lack of response by them to either hero.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Yates appears to be rather gullible and believes in the supernatural, and often wastes time by
                        conducting extremely trivial investigations. He seems to enjoy letting other people solve crimes
                        for him, be they supposed psychic mediums, the Hardly Boys, Butters Stotch, or Mysterion
                        (Kenny). He is also stupid (possibly slightly more so than Officer Barbrady), racist and
                        misogynistic, the last two of which he is perfectly willing to misuse the law to satisfy.</p>

                    <p>Like most other South Park citizens, however, he does not notice these negative traits or rather
                        believes they are good. His microscopic intelligence is showcased when it took him (presumably)
                        hours of extensive research to understand that a left-hand remains as such, regardless of the
                        angle of which it's seen.</p>

                    <p>There is a possibility that he is a closet homosexual or at least bisexual, as depicted in
                        "Butters' Bottom Bitch", where he takes his prostitute role way too seriously by engaging in
                        sexual contact with multiple male clients and marries his pimp in order to arrest him. However,
                        it is possible that he was just taking his job too far without having any sexual feelings for
                        the said men. In "Naughty Ninjas", he suggests he "might even kiss a dude" while hula dancing,
                        further adding to the speculation.</p>

                    <p>He seems to show intolerance towards wealthy African-Americans especially the Black family. In
                        "The Jeffersons", he gets deeply disgusted when he finds out Mr. Jefferson was actually an
                        African American man. In "The Pandemic Special", he accidentally shoots Tolkien and shows no
                        remorse for his actions. Harrison also refers to Tolkien as the patient zero for COVID-19 at
                        South Park Elementary. In South Park: The Streaming Wars Part 2, rather than fully investigating
                        Steve's disappearance, he shows up to Credigree Weed to tell Linda Black about her husband's
                        presumed death but shows no empathy.</p>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Herbert Garrison</i>, who was formerly known as Janet Garrison after a
                        sex-change operation, is a 4th
                        grade teacher at South Park Elementary. He first appears in the Season One episode, "Cartman
                        Gets an Anal Probe", and is voiced by Trey Parker.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Garrison was a man throughout the first nine seasons of South Park until "Mr. Garrison's
                        Fancy New Vagina", where he received gender confirmation surgery and became a woman. In "Eek, A
                        Penis!", he later got a reverse sex change operation in becoming male again.</p>

                    <p>He ran for President in Season Nineteen, eventually gaining the Republican nomination. He became
                        elected as President of the United States in the Season Twenty episode "Oh, Jeez" and appears as
                        the 45th President of the United States from Seasons Twenty-One to Twenty-Three. However, in the
                        Season Twenty-Four episode "South ParQ Vaccination Special", he returned to South Park to
                        continue his work as a 4th grade teacher.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Herbert Garrison grew up in Arkansas, where most of his problems originated. Even at a young age,
                        Garrison showed signs of homosexuality, when he felt unloved by his father when he would not
                        molest him. Garrison knew about many cases of child molestation and saw it as a form of love,
                        not a disturbing crime. Garrison received a degree of mechanical engineering in college. It is
                        unsure when, but instead of becoming an engineer like he was qualified to be, Garrison became
                        the third-grade teacher at South Park Elementary, despite his lack of knowledge of his subjects.
                        Despite being a homosexual, he would react in negativity or "go nuts" if anyone would ask him if
                        he was gay, once using the excuse of "acting like it to get chicks." He was caught trying to
                        molest a boy, Eric Cartman, who was looking to find an older and more mature person to hang out
                        with. After Garrison was released from prison, he was fired from his job for what he tried to do
                        and decided to pursue a career in writing romance novels. He published one novel, which
                        unfortunately for him won an award in Best Homo-erotic Novel, despite the novel’s main audience
                        was women. This let him to having a severe breakdown causing him to leave to the mountains to
                        live in solitude. When Ms. Choksondik comes to see him in the mountain for advice on how to
                        handle his class, he realized that he must admit his sexuality and gets a different job at South
                        Park Elementary, teaching the Kindergarten class.</p>

                        class="image-style-options-left img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Herbert Garrison with man image">

                    <p>After Ms. Choksondik's death, Garrison was promoted as the Fourth Grade teacher and was reunited
                        with his old class. He had started a new relationship with a man called Mr. Slave, who in the
                        episode "The Death Camp of Tolerance" was used by Garrison to try and get himself fired for
                        being gay, so that he could sue the school for millions of dollars. This did not work and The
                        Boys ended up getting sent to tolerance camp. The Boys were released from the camp due to his
                        behavior at the Tolerance Museum and unfortunately for Mr. Garrison, he got sent to the camp
                        himself, along with Mr. Slave, deemed intolerant of their own homosexuality. In "Mr. Garrison's
                        Fancy New Vagina", he got a sex change operation, realizing he was not gay, but just a woman
                        stuck in a man's body and changed her name to Janet. This led to the break up of her and Mr.
                        Slave, who said he liked having sex with men, not women. It was at this point that Mrs. Garrison
                        became homophobic once more and returned to her original beliefs on homosexuals. Ms. Garrison
                        was very promiscuous with her sexuality, claiming to have let truckers 'do' her in their trucks.
                    </p>

                    <p>After she learned she could not have periods or get pregnant, Ms. Garrison decided she was not
                        actually a woman, but it was too late to have the operation undone, and she accepted what she
                        was. When Ms. Garrison learned that Mr. Slave was going to marry Big Gay Al, she tried to stop
                        the governor from passing the law for gay marriage, by having two of her male students (Stan &
                        Kyle) take care of an egg. She expected the two to break the egg, thus proving gay couples were
                        irresponsible and could not take care of a child. The egg, though, was still intact by the end
                        of the project, letting gay couples marry. Ms. Garrison was morally opposed to teaching
                        evolution in "Go God Go" and was replaced by Richard Dawkins as the teacher. After initially
                        fighting one another, the two form a relationship and Richard Dawkins convinces Ms. Garrison to
                        give up Christianity and become an atheist like him. Dawkin's views on atheism and Ms.
                        Garrison's 'assertion' combined would apparently lead to the world becoming atheists. Their
                        relationship ends, though, when Eric Cartman reveals that Ms. Garrison used to be a man.</p>

                    <p>Ms. Garrison explored her sexuality some more after mistakenly going into a Lesbian Bar and
                        ending up having sex with a woman named Allison. She took to her new sexuality quickly,
                        defending Lesbian rights and Les Bos, the bar where she became gay again. Yet in "Eek, A
                        Penis!", after watching the famous show of Oprah about Thomas Beatie, she realizes that the sex
                        change operation was a big mistake. She pays to have her penis re-grown using her DNA and became
                        a man once more. It is unknown if he is once more homosexual after his sexual encounter with
                        women. In the episode "The Cissy", where Cartman requests to use the girl's washroom because he
                        claims he is transgender or as Cartman says "transginger", Mr. Garrison advises Principal
                        Victoria to give in to avoid the scandal Cartman is almost certain to cause otherwise, speaking
                        from experience as he was once transgender himself.</p>

                    <p>In "Where My Country Gone?", he starts to speak out against the undocumented immigrants
                        (Canadians) in the country, which results in him being fired from South Park Elementary. He then
                        starts a movement to "fuck 'em all to death" and to build a wall separating the countries; only
                        to find that the Canadian President has already built a wall to keep out the Americans. He
                        sneaks into Canada, and literally fucks the Canadian president to death, which results in mass
                        reverse-immigrations. He later bids in the Presidential Elections. In "Sponsored Content" at the
                        Debate, he suggests fucking all the Syrian Refugees to death, believing they are all ISIS
                        soldiers. It also seems that he has a lot more supporters than Hillary Clinton. He also returns
                        to South Park with Principal Victoria and Caitlyn Jenner to stop the town's fate of ending.</p>

                        alt="Herbert Garrison with member berry image">

                    <p>In Season Twenty Garrison is still running for President, but after realizing he could win and
                        does not have any plans to do in his presidency, he tries to foil the election in order to lose
                        his supporters by trying to sit down the national anthem during a football game, however he
                        fails since the rebooted version of the national anthem allows people to sit, stand, or kneel.
                        He again tries to foil the election by making derogatory remarks against women and the TSA
                        during a campaign rally. Instead of losing supporters, he instead gets chased by an angry mob
                        demanding answers. When he finds out that the reason of why he was gaining more supporters was
                        because of the memberberries, he tries to destroy them with Randy but to no avail. However,
                        having consumed a memberberry himself, he goes on his campaign and wins the election.</p>

                    <p>In Season Twenty-One, though stating how he can handle societal psychology, despite being
                        informed, his approval ratings are very low as depicted in the episode "Doubling Down", a
                        desperate Garrison ends up running back to South Park after launching a nuke at Toronto that
                        killed a million Canadians at the end of "SUPER HARD PCness". During the events of "Splatty
                        Tomato", he starts appearing all over South Park scaring people by asking about his approval
                        ratings. Eventually, he is found and captured, but manages to escape while everyone is looking
                        away.</p>

                    <p>In "South ParQ Vaccination Special", Garrison becomes a fourth-grade teacher again after he is
                        shown to have lost the election, and he returns to South Park along with a man sidekick named
                        Mr. Service. He acts oblivious to his tenure as president and attempts to continue on with his
                        normal life. He uses the Hollywood Elites to warp reality and turn Mr. Service into Mr. Hat, and
                        manages to return to being the teacher for the 4th grade students.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Herbert Garrison suffers from many psychological problems that are touched many times throughout
                        the show, though it appears nothing is ever done about it. The most noticeable of his problems
                        are multiple identity disorder, represented through various puppets. At the beginning of the
                        series, while Mr. Garrison still taught Third Grade, he held a puppet on his hand known as Mr.
                        Hat. Mr. Garrison used this puppet to show a second, more aggressive personality and to emote
                        some of his most inner conflicts. One of these conflicts being the fact he was gay and his
                        inability to come to terms with that. It was hinted many times that he was gay, but Mr. Garrison
                        would take deep offense and insist he was straight. He would say Mr. Hat was gay and later
                        admitted his second-hand puppet, Mr. Twig, was also gay. Mr. Garrison denied the fact he was gay
                        so much, that he even appeared homophobic and believed gay people were an abomination and were
                        not human. In one particular episode, he tells Stan, "Gay people are evil. Their hearts pump not
                        blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil."</p>

                    <p>Garrison is very outspoken, often campaigning to have changes made that he feels are right or to
                        block other people's ideals and can be considered heavily opinionated. During certain seasons
                        and on occasion, he will slur the last part of a word in a sentence especially when he is saying
                        something in emphasis.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Garrison is racist, first shown as a gag for "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", where he
                        proposes the town gets rid of all the Mexicans every Christmas, which he again suggests in "It's
                        Christmas in Canada", to which the Mayor angrily replies "Mr. Garrison, every year you suggest
                        that and every year we tell you NO!" When rich black people were moving to South Park, he was
                        able to gather the town's men into getting rid of them, under the pretense that the rich people
                        were taking over the town. He got people to dress up like "ghosts" to scare them away and burned
                        lower case T's on the black peoples' lawns standing for "Time to Leave." Once the town was rid
                        of the rich people,</p>

                    <img src="../img/characters/minor_characters/herbert_garrison_4.webp"
                        class="image-style-options-left img-thumbnail rounded"
                        alt="Herbert Garrison with mr. Slave image">

                    <p>Mr. Garrison said they could all get rich by selling the houses. This confused the town folk, who
                        replied that they would then become what they did not want in the town. Mr. Garrison then
                        exposed his true motive by saying "Well, at least we got rid of those damn nig-" (and the
                        episode cuts to black and the credits roll). Mr. Garrison was also seen among a KKK group, but
                        said he was not a member, but Mr. Hat was, again using his puppet to dispute the conflicts
                        inside himself. Mr. Garrison appears to be on good terms with Chef though, a black man who works
                        at the school and was even at his funeral.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Garrison is an incompetent teacher, who teaches his students useless things, such as why
                        Chubby Checker left the Beatles and once spent a whole week of just showing his class old
                        Barnaby Jones tapes. He has also taught his students a few times subjects far too advanced for
                        them, like Joseph Stalin and communism. There have only been a few instances, mostly in more
                        recent episodes, when Mr. Garrison has been portrayed as more competent as of a teacher taught a
                        normal subject for a Fourth Grade class (many instances being after his sex change to a woman
                        and back to a man), mostly Times Tables. Yet he goes about it by insulting the kids when they
                        get an answer wrong, which is often. It is possible that Mr. Garrison teaches the students more
                        about pop culture because he himself does not know a lot about the school curriculum, or just
                        does not pay attention to it.</p>

                    <p>One of Mr. Garrison's common personality traits since giving up Mr. Hat is how his aggressive
                        behavior now causes him to take things to the extremes. When he came out as gay, he began
                        performing extremely vulgar homosexual acts with Mr. Slave. Of course, part of this was most
                        likely because of the fact he wanted to get fired in order to sue the school. However, after
                        becoming a woman, he became obsessed with declaring how much of a woman he was in the loudest
                        and again most vulgar way. For example, he once shouted loudly to other women about how
                        wonderful it was to have a period. Later, when Mrs. Garrison begins a brief relationship with
                        Richard Dawkins, she gives up her religious faith due to the fact the Dawkins found her
                        attractive and then became obnoxiously vocal about Atheism to the point of being fanatical. The
                        same held true for when Mrs. Garrison decided to become a lesbian following a one-night stand
                        with another woman. Following the encounter, Mrs. Garrison began to sexually harass all the
                        women at the local lesbian bar and became obsessed with the idea of having random sex with
                        women. These extreme shifts and stances of belief mixed with his already aggressive behavior
                        make it to where Garrison is often verbally abusive to any and all who disagree with him. All of
                        this suggests that he is an extreme narcissist.</p>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Heidi Turner</i> is a female fourth-grade student at South Park
                        Elementary. She first appears as a
                        background character in the Season Three episode, "Rainforest Shmainforest", and made her first
                        speaking role in the 1999 film, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Heidi is portrayed as one of
                        the "popular girls" in the fourth grade. She is usually seen with Wendy, Bebe, Red, Nichole,
                        Annie, Nelly, Jenny, Lola, and many other fourth grade girls. She hosted a sleepover in the
                        Season Nine episode, "Marjorine", at which most of the "popular girls" attended, once again
                        illustrating her popularity. She has been shown with different parents in four separate
                        instances, most likely continuity errors. She serves as the primary female character in Season
                        Twenty and Twenty-One.</p>

                    <p>Heidi went from being a minor background character that was introduced in Season Three to a much
                        larger presence in South Park. Like other characters used mostly in the background of the early
                        seasons, her model would be used to fill in space and was occasionally given color swaps.</p>

                    <p>Later, as the series progressed, Heidi was given a permanent color scheme and eventually a name,
                        making her more usable for recurring roles. She obtained further establishment in the episode
                        "Marjorine", where she was shown more prominently, hosting a slumber party. In the episode,
                        Cartman shows the male 4th graders a recording in which the girls, including Heidi, are seen
                        using a "fortune-telling device". During Cartman's meeting, Heidi's full name is revealed for
                        the first time. Cartman tells the boys that Heidi will be hosting a slumber party which will be
                        a perfect opportunity for them to take the "fortune-telling device" from the girls, as well as
                        learn out how to use it. The boys decide to set up Butters' fake death and send him to the party
                        disguised as a girl. After Butters' fake death, he arrives at South Park Elementary dressed as a
                        girl and introduces himself to the class as Marjorine. Heidi is seen in Ms. Garrison's class for
                        the first time.</p>

                    <p>Nancy Turner tells her that she also invited Marjorine to the party, much to Heidi's anger. At
                        the party, all the girls pick on Marjorine for being ugly and flat with Heidi telling her that
                        nobody wants her at the party and that she should leave. After the girls hear Marjorine crying
                        in the bathroom, they apologize and decide to give her a makeover. Heidi gives Marjorine the
                        "fortune-telling device" and teaches her how to use it, but after Thomas Turner revealed that
                        there is a boy at the party. Marjorine takes the device and leaves.</p>

                    <p>Since then, she has kept her place in the girls' clique throughout the series. Her role had
                        seemed to be gradually growing, but had not dropped off until "The Hobbit". Heidi became a key
                        character in Season Twenty, as she was forced off of social media by the internet troll
                        Skankhunt42, and eventually became Eric Cartman's girlfriend, joining with him to end the gender
                        war engulfing the school.</p>

                    <p>In "Member Berries", before the volleyball game, she sits down during the American National
                        Anthem and plays with the team. After the game, she asks PC Principal what he will do about
                        Cartman, assuming he is lying about Skankhunt42 and requests that PC Principal checks Cartman's
                        phone.</p>

                    <p>She quits social media in a dramatic way, by tossing her phone into the river in "Skank Hunt".
                        The next day, she walks down the hallway with her head down as Stan tells Kyle that she has quit
                        Twitter for good. Heidi can be seen sitting in the library during Mr. Mackey's Twitter funeral
                        for her. When the girls are talking about taking action against Skankhunt42 on the playground,
                        Heidi is standing with them.</p>

                    <p>During "The Damned", when Cartman is walking alone in the hallway, Heidi calls to him and leads
                        him to the park where she and other people who do not use Twitter go. There, she comforts him
                        about his broken electronics after showing him the park. Later, she apologizes for accusing
                        Cartman of being Skankhunt42, talks with him about his assembly, and becomes his friend. The
                        next day, Heidi talks with Cartman about her lack of followers. At M Burgers, Cartman and Heidi
                        eat together. When he asks her if girls have balls, she offers to show him her vagina.</p>

                    <p>She is seen in a relationship with Cartman during "Wieners Out", bringing him chocolate milk and
                        receiving a necklace from him. At Sizzler, Cartman and Heidi hold hands while talking with Kyle
                        about the gains of women and Butters needing to be stopped. Cartman becomes defensive of her
                        when Kyle says "we need the old Cartman back", thinking that he has an issue with his
                        relationship with her. Heidi tells Kyle that the two of them are "out of it now" after leaving
                        social media behind.</p>

                    <p>In "Douche and a Danish", Heidi delays the fight between Nelly and Butters with Cartman, giving
                        him a kiss. She holds an assembly with Cartman to propose the idea of a school fundraiser for
                        TrollTrace.com to stop the cyberbullying issues in South Park and the rest of the world. She
                        talks about her school fundraiser, Danishes for Denmark, in Mrs. Nelson's class before Mr.
                        Garrison tries to teach the class, pretending that he is not running for president. While the
                        students help with Danishes for Denmark, Heidi and Cartman sing "Let's Come Together As a
                        School" together. Due to the List of Internet Trolls attacking Denmark, nobody wants to buy
                        danishes from Heidi's school fundraiser. Heidi runs away and cries when she realized her plan
                        failed, resulting in Cartman comforting her. Later, she and Cartman send a VHS to Denmark in
                        which she believes to know the source of the troll attack.</p>

                    <p>At M Burgers, Heidi goes on a date with Cartman and talks with him about Kyle, worried about his
                        relationship with Cartman and the rest of the boys during the events of "Fort Collins". Heidi
                        and Cartman talk with Kyle in his bathroom about their plans with Denmark. She invites Kyle to
                        her house, revealing her plan to identify Skankhunt42 using "Emoji Analysis", telling Cartman
                        and Kyle she thinks Skankhunt42 is a student's parent. A Danish worker mentions her and her
                        Emoji Analysis, helping the Danish locate the source of the troll attack. Heidi is mentioned
                        when Kyle tells Cartman about the possibility of her finding out about his internet history.
                        Cartman later lies to her to keep his internet history secret, and she believes him.</p>

                    <h4>Ike Broflovski</h4>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Sir Ike Moisha Broflovski</i>, born as Peter Gintz, is Kyle
                        Broflovski's adopted younger brother from
                        Canada. He made his first appearance in the Season One episode, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".
                        His voice has been provided by many children, usually relatives of show personnel due to
                        their young-sounding voice, as described during the commentary of "Trapper Keeper". He has also
                        been mistaken for both a trash can and a table post, as well as compared to a football. Unlike
                        other Canadians, Ike does not have a Canadian accent or a box-shaped body and has a nose,
                        although that could be because he is so young and has presumably lived in the United States for
                        a majority of his life. However, when he grows up to his adult stage, he gains these features
                        and loses his nose.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <img src="../img/characters/minor_characters/ike.webp"
                        class="image-style-options-1 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Ike Broflovski image">

                    <p>Ike was adopted by Gerald and Sheila Broflovski. Ike's birth parents, Harry and Elise Gintz (who
                        christened Ike "Peter") gave him up for adoption because Canada had been "devastated by the Cola
                        Wars" and as a result, they were unable to raise a child.</p>

                    <p>This fact was introduced after the flappy heads and beady eyes were established as Canadian
                        traits in the world of South Park. Since Ike was designed with both, Matt and Trey decided to
                        make Ike Canadian by birth, and therefore, adopted.</p>

                    <p>In the fourth season, it is revealed that Ike is a genius, and is sent to kindergarten early.
                        This was not evident at first however, proof of Ike's genius is visible in many later episodes.
                        He composes sheet music, reads John Steinbeck, and watches "The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer" every
                        night. In South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, he expertly played the harmonica when Kyle hid him
                        in the attic, and in "Smug Alert!", Ike finished several of Kyle's sentences when the boys tried
                        to tell their father that he is becoming alienated from his friends. In the same episode, when
                        offered LSD, Ike asked for "3 hits". He also once made a perfect replica of Leonardo da Vinci's
                        "Last Supper" painting out of macaroni as a project for his Jewish camp, which completely
                        offended his unimpressed troop leader. In "About Last Night...", he is seen helping Barack Obama
                        and John McCain steal the Hope Diamond, as a demolition specialist and computer hacker. He can
                        play the piano very well in "Fatbeard" and seems to know how to drive a boat.</p>

                    <p>In "Stanley's Cup", the South Park Pee-Wee hockey team hires Ike to join their team based solely
                        on the fact that he is Canadian. To the other members of the Pee-Wee team, Ike seems to be a
                        very good player, due to the fact that he can hit pucks into the goal, while the other members
                        could not do so.</p>

                    <p>Ike is at times very aware of things going on around him, from trying to reconcile with his
                        brother to auditioning for Eric Cartman's boy band and flipping Cartman off when he does not
                        make the cut. Ike was also aware of how unpopular he initially was with his kindergarten
                        classmates, who were jealous of the fact that he was admitted at only age three. However, he
                        rallied enough support to force a tie in the election for class president, finally winning when
                        his opponent (who was fed up with all the negotiations and meddling by his aunt Rosie O'Donnell)
                        conceded defeat.</p>

                    <p>Ike has falsely attempted suicide twice, once in "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy" and again in "About
                        Last Night..." (but that was only to get to the hospital computers when he was hired by both
                        McCain and Obama).</p>

                    <p>In the episode "Fatbeard" Ike joins Cartman's pirate crew and goes to Somalia with him because he
                        grew tired of his home life. However, when he and Butters hear the story of a real Somalian
                        pirate, who tells them they should not want to be a pirate and that they should be happy with
                        their lives in America, he wants to go home again. This is one of the first episodes where Ike's
                        dialogue is actively coherent to the audience throughout the entire episode as opposed to
                        nonsensical comments.</p>

                    <p>Kyle is known to punt Ike like a football after saying, "Kick the baby!", to which Ike responds,
                        "Don't kick the (goddamn) baby!"</p>

                    <p>Because he is a genius, Ike was accepted into kindergarten at the age of 3. There, Mr. Garrison
                        nominates him for class president, Ike's opponent being Filmore. The vote is tied, as a little
                        classmate of theirs named "Flora" (spoofing Florida's role in the 2000 US Presidential Election)
                        cannot make up her mind and Filmore's aunt shows up to demand that Filmore be declared class
                        president. Eventually, Filmore gives up and Ike becomes class president (to which he can only
                        exclaim (loudly), "I pooped my pants!").</p>

                    <p>At one point, Ike has an affair with his kindergarten teacher, Ms. Stevenson, during which he
                        loses his virginity, becoming the youngest person on the show to do so. They planned to run off
                        to Milan (to which Ike replies, "Yay, Mulan!", confusing Milan with the Disney character Mulan).
                        Before they leave, Kyle helps him come back to his senses. As Ike and his teacher are on the
                        roof of a hotel, they both run to the edge, but Ike skids to a stop. Ms. Stevenson jumps anyway
                        and leaps to her death.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <p>Ike appears to idolize his older brother. He has often tried to follow him to school as shown in
                        "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" and "Cancelled". He often copies the words Kyle has said, even
                        obscenities, as shown in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Conversely, one of the few examples
                        of Ike getting angry at Kyle occurred when Kyle interrupted Ike's news program and changed the
                        channel. Kyle has superficial malice towards Ike, but in several episodes, most notably "Ike's
                        Wee Wee," it is shown that Kyle does indeed love his brother. In "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy", Ike
                        was angry with Kyle because he tried to break up his relationship with the Kindergarten teacher.
                        Furthermore, he is clearly heard saying, "You are dead to me, Kyle!"</p>

                    <p>Ike often tries to pronounce words but fails. However, in the episode "Mr. Garrison's Fancy New
                        Vagina", he can say, "penis" and "vagina" quite clearly and in "Cancelled" he tells Kyle to
                        "suck my balls". Despite his intelligence, Ike often replies to questions with random answers.
                        Some of Ike's random statements are "cookie monster," "Ring Around the Rosie," "I pooped my
                        pants," "I don't like medicine," and various nonsensical burbling. Statements like these tend to
                        serve as catch-all phrases and non sequitur answers to questions Ike is asked. Even in a heated
                        argument with Kyle in "Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy," Ike can clearly be heard saying, "Ring Around
                        the Rosie!" in an angry tone.</p>

                    <p>In the future timeline of South Park: Post Covid: The Return of Covid, Ike speaks in the typical
                        Canadian manner, constantly using words such as buddy, guy, and friend.</p>

                    <h4>Jack Tenorman</h4>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Jack Tenorman</i> was Eric Cartman's and Scott Tenorman's father who
                        appeared (and eventually died)
                        in the Season Five episode, "Scott Tenorman Must Die".</p>

                    <p>Cartman bought Scott Tenorman's pubic hair in "Scott Tenorman Must Die", thinking that it was the
                        means by which to reach maturity. Finding out that he was mistaken, he attempts to get revenge
                        on Scott.</p>

                    <p>After several fruitless attempts, Cartman creates an elaborate scheme in which he tricks Scott
                        into convincing his parents to "save" a pony from being slaughtered at Bill Denkins's ranch. In
                        the meantime, he told Denkins that Jack and his wife were both a pair of demented pony-killers
                        who should be shot on sight. When Scott's father Jack and his mother attempted to save the pony,
                        they were shot dead by Denkins. While he filed a report to Officer Barbrady, Cartman gathered
                        their bodies and then proceeded to grind them up and feed them to Scott as chili.</p>

                    <p>The fact that his parents were murdered and that he later ate them, drove Scott completely
                        insane. In "200" and "201", it is discovered that during his time in a mental institution, Scott
                        began to research Cartman's history in the hopes of exacting revenge upon him. During his
                        research, Scott discovered that his own father Jack Tenorman had played right tackle for the
                        Denver Broncos during his younger years and that during the night of the Drunken Barn Dance, he
                        had sex with Cartman's mother Liane resulting in her getting pregnant with Eric.</p>

                    <p>It is unknown whether or not Jack was ever aware of the pregnancy. However, Liane seemed to have
                        informed the rest of the town. Due to the fact that the Denver Broncos had been having a really
                        good year, they all believed that revealing that Jack Tenorman having a bastard child who wants
                        to meet him could be enough to distract him from the football season. As such, when Eric years
                        later, attempted to discover the truth about his father in "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut" and
                        "Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut", the entire town covered up the truth and altered the
                        paternity results, and told Eric that his mother was in truth his father, due to her being a
                        hermaphrodite.</p>

                    <p>After discovering this, Scott Tenorman resurrected the Ginger Separatist Movement that Cartman
                        had once formed, in order to use them in an elaborate scheme to reveal the truth to Cartman in
                        the hopes of demoralizing him. Scott's plan unfortunately worked, but not in the way he

                    <p><i class="character-name">Jake</i> was a member of the Getting Gay With Kids choir, shown in
                        "Rainforest Shmainforest". His
                        appearance was short-lived, however, as he got too close to a carnivorous flower and was
                        presumably eaten. Despite Ms. Stevens presumably failing to save him, he was seen later in the
                        episode, so it should be assumed that he is alive.</p>

                    <p>Jake had a cameo in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (most notably at the "La Resistance"
                        meeting, which he left due to there being no "punch and pie"), at the dance in "Hooked on Monkey
                        Fonics", and as a prisoner at Alamosa Maximum Security Juvenile Hall in "Cartman's Silly Hate
                        Crime 2000".</p>

                    <p>Jake has short, grayish-brown hair, had freckles, and wears a green sweater and brown pants. In
                        South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, he wears a yellow sweater.</p>

                    <h6>Personality</h6>

                    <p>Jake knows everything about the rainforest and is a part of the Getting Gay with Kids choir. He
                        may have died because he was being eaten by a carnivorous flower and Ms. Stevens was trying to
                        get Jake out; it is possible that Ms. Stevens succeeded (as he is seen in other shots), or
                        didn't succeed and there was an error in his continuation on the show, since he did appear in a
                        couple of episodes like "Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000" (in this example he was a prisoner),
                        made a cameo in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (he was the one who wanted to know if there
                        was punch and pie or not and after that he left the meeting), and was seen at the dance in
                        "Hooked on Monkey Fonics". In the episode "Rainforest Shmainforest", he is the only kid other
                        than Kelly who had lines the whole episode until he possibly died from being eaten by the
                        carnivorous flower.</p>

                        ate Subway sandwiches but later admitted that he actually had help from his assistants, who he

                    <h4>Jerome "Chef" McElroy</h4>

                    <p><i class="character-name">Jerome McElroy</i>, commonly referred to as<i
                            class="character-name">Chef</i>, was a recurring character in South Park. He was
                        most famous for being the South Park Elementary cafeteria chef and the boys' go-to guy for
                        advice, which would often result into him breaking into songs about sex. He made his debut in
                        the Season One episode "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" and was voiced by the late Isaac Hayes.</p>

                    <p>Chef was killed off in the Season Ten debut episode, "The Return of Chef", following controversy
                        with Isaac Hayes, who left the series after the episode, "Trapped in the Closet" aired, due to
                        its portrayal of Scientology.</p>

                    <h6>Background</h6>
                    <hr />

                    <img src="../img/characters/minor_characters/jerome_Chef.webp"
                        class="image-style-options-1 img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Chef image">

                    <p>As his nickname implies, Chef was a school cafeteria cook at the South Park Elementary School and
                        former member of City Council as "Head of Public Safety". He was the only adult that the boys
                        (Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny) consistently looked to for advice</p>

                    <p>Chef used the word "children" often, even for a singular child. For example, he referred to
                        Cartman as "children" in "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut" and "Spontaneous Combustion," Stan in
                        "Kenny Dies," and Butters in "The Simpsons Already Did It". He also tended to use "fudge" as a
                        euphemism for "fuck," particularly in early episodes. The various humorously named snacks he
                        made in "Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls" epitomized this.</p>

                    <p>While most of the inhabitants of South Park are Caucasian, Chef was one of the very few residents
                        in town who was African American; in fact, the only other black people to consistently live in
                        South Park are Tolkien and his parents, who were not prominent characters until the fourth
                        season. As a result, Chef (usually affectionately, though not always) referred to most people in
                        town with the racial slur "crackers", often "cracker-ass", including the children.</p>

                    <p>Aside from cooking, Chef was passionate about singing - he wrote the song, "Stinky Britches"
                        which was later covered by Alanis Morissette. He was based on such 1970s African American
                        singers as Isaac Hayes and Barry White. Often, he agreed to give the boys advice in the form of
                        songs but wound up singing about having sex. However, over time, like many earlier characters on
                        the show, his role, especially as a singer, diminished, and in later seasons he did not sing
                        much. By the time his death occurred, he had not sung any songs in 4 years or so, with one of
                        the last examples of him singing being "The Simpsons Already Did It".</p>

                    <p>Despite his preoccupations with women and sex, Chef was generally one of the few level-headed
                        adults in South Park. In addition to dispensing advice to "the children", Chef spoke out against
                        outrageous ideas and helped save South Park/the world in general from disasters on numerous
                        occasions. However, Chef was not above performing nonsensical acts, such as buying a fancy TV
                        that he could not even program.</p>

                    <p>In earlier seasons, Chef was often approached by the children when they were unfamiliar with a
                        sexual term or practice. This happened so often that it eventually got on Chef's nerves, leading
                        him to say, "Goddammit, children, why do I always have to be the one to teach you these
                        things?", but went on to explain to them whatever they wanted to know anyway.</p>

                    <p>In "Chef Goes Nanners", he briefly converted to Islam and adopted the name "Abdul Mohammed Jabar
                        Rauf Kareem Ali", but converted back to Christianity by the end of the episode.</p>

                    <p>The fate of Chef was revealed in the Season 10 premiere, in which voice clips taken from previous
                        episodes were linked together to form new dialogue to support the plot of "The Return of Chef".
                        In the episode, Chef was brainwashed into becoming a child molester by the Super Adventure Club,
                        an organization which combines outdoors activities with sex tourism and bizarre religious
                        beliefs, some of which seem akin to those held by the real-life Church of Scientology.</p>

                    <p>At the end of the episode, Chef was burned, battered, impaled, shot, his face, including one
                        eyeball, was pulled off, and his limbs were torn apart by a grizzly bear and a mountain lion, he
                        gets split in half, and he finally defecated as he died as a reference to the episode "Something
                        Wall-Mart This Way Comes".</p>

                    <p>The town held a moving memorial service for him, in which Kyle gave a eulogy stating, "We
                        shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us, we should be mad at that fruity little club for
                        scrambling his brains" - a not-so-subtle jab at Scientology.</p>

                        farsightedness, due to the magnification of his eyes. He made his first appearance in the Season

                    <p>While his mother is in the hospital, Kyle stays with the Broflovski family during the events of
                        "The Entity". He is a stereotypical American Jewish kid (with characteristics such as
                        hypochondria, poor athleticism and being good with money), unlike Kyle, who is worried about his
                        anti-Semitic friend Cartman, whom he fears will constantly make fun of him. Kyle then offers
                        Cartman forty dollars not to make fun of Kyle Schwartz. Cartman initially tries to comply with
                        the agreement, but later makes a concentration camp joke in class, blowing the deal.</p>

                    <p>Kyle Schwartz then states that Kyle (Broflovski) should have tried to get away with paying
                        Cartman $12.50, instead of $40. Angered by his ingratitude and personal quirks, the boys help
                        Kyle try to get rid of him. They put him on a sled tied to a bus headed for Connecticut, and
                        later seal him in a box and place him on a plane to Antarctica. He nevertheless keeps returning
                        to the Broflovski home. In the end, his mother's condition improves, and he decides to go home
                        after receiving $5,000,000 from an investment bailout to the airlines. The boys suddenly see
                        their opportunity and try to convince him to stay, but Kyle Schwartz replies by saying that he
                        couldn't stand how everyone in South Park is a stereotypical hillbilly jock redneck.</p>

                    <p>Kyle also appears in "Red Sleigh Down", where he calculates how many presents Cartman will get
                        for Christmas, concluding that he will still owe two presents even if he finds a cure for cancer
                        and AIDS before Christmas, and "The Losing Edge", where the boys play on the South Park Little
                        League Baseball Team and have to get the worst person they can find to play because they do not
                        want to qualify for a national tournament.</p>

                    <p>Kip seems to be an outcast, who has no friends at all because everyone made fun of his
                        appearance. In fact, he went six months on Facebook without a single friend request. As a
                        result, he seemed to suffer from severe depression and would sit at his computer all day,
                        waiting and praying for a friend request. This changed when Kyle Broflovski felt sorry for him
                        and added him as a result.</p>

                    <p>Kyle's addition overjoyed Kip who began thinking of Kyle's Facebook friendship as a much deeper
                        thing and began to address Kyle as his best friend, where sometimes he would wait for hours just
                        staring at his Facebook page just for Kyle to reply and bring his computer to the movies while
                        taking pictures of himself with Kyle's Facebook page. He would then proceed to tell his parents
                        all the inane details of their collective Facebook updates.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, Kip's status as a loser negatively affected Kyle, who lost all his Facebook
                        friends except for Kip and later Stan (who Kyle had to beg to friend him). Eric Cartman
                        meanwhile features Kyle and Kip on his podcast, Mad Friends, in which he informs Facebook
                        participants to steer clear of Kyle because of his association with Kip. Although reluctant at
                        first, Kyle eventually removes him as a friend, resulting in Kip falling back into his depressed
                        state. However, by the end of the episode, he had 845,323 friends on Facebook, due to Stan
                        shutting down his profile and transferring his friends to Kip, thus restoring Kip to being
                        extremely overjoyed.</p>
