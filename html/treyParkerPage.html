                <p>Randolph Severn "Trey" Parker III (born October 19, 1969) is an American actor, animator, writer,
                    producer, director, and composer. He is known for co-creating South Park (1997–present) and
                    co-developing The Book of Mormon (2011) with his creative partner Matt Stone. Parker was interested
                    in film and music as a child and at high school and attended the University of Colorado, Boulder,
                    where he met Stone. The two collaborated on various short films. They also co-wrote and co-starred
                    in the feature-length musical Cannibal! The Musical (1993).</p>

                <p>Parker and Stone moved to Los Angeles and wrote their second film, Orgazmo (1997). Before the
                    premiere of the film, South Park premiered on Comedy Central in August 1997. The duo possess full
                    creative control of the show, and have produced music and video games based on it. A film based on
                    the series, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (1999), received good reviews from both critics and
                    fans. Parker went on to write, produce, direct, and star in the satirical action film Team America:
                    World Police (2004), and, after several years of development, The Book of Mormon premiered on
                    Broadway to good reviews. In 2013, Parker and Stone established their own production studio,
                    Important Studios.</p>

                <p>Parker has received five Primetime Emmy Awards for his work on South Park, four Tony Awards and a
                    Grammy Award for The Book of Mormon, and an Academy Award nomination for the song "Blame Canada"
                    from the South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut movie, co-written with Marc Shaiman.</p>

                <h4>Early life</h4>

                <p>Parker was born in Conifer, Colorado, the son of insurance saleswoman Sharon and geologist Randolph
                    "Randy" Parker. He was a shy child who received "decent" grades and was involved in honors
                    classes. He idolized Monty Python, which he began watching on television in the third grade. His
                    later ventures into animation would bear considerable influence from Terry Gilliam. In the sixth
                    grade, Parker wrote a sketch titled The Dentist and appeared in his school's talent show. He played
                    the dentist and had a friend play the patient. The plot involved what can go wrong at the dentist;
                    due to the amounts of fake blood involved, Parker's parents were called and were upset, with Parker
                    later recalling that "the kindergartners were all crying and freaking out".</p>

                    class="trey-image-young img-thumbnail rounded" alt="Young Trey image">

                <p>Parker has described himself as "the typical big-dream kid" who envisioned a career in film and
                    music. He made short films on the weekends with a group of friends, beginning when he was 14. His
                    father had purchased him a video camera and the group continued making films until graduation.
                    He became interested in pursuing music at 17, but only comedy-centered songs; he wrote and recorded
                    a full-length comedy album, Immature: A Collection of Love Ballads For The '80's Man, with friend
                    David Goodman during this time. As a teenager, Parker developed a love for musical theatre, and
                    joined the Evergreen Players, a venerable mountain community theater outside of Denver. At 14, he
                    performed his first role as chorus member in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and Flower Drum
                    Song and went on to also design sets for the community theater's production of Little Shop of
                    Horrors. In high school, he also played piano for the chorus and was president of the choir
                    counsel. As Evergreen was nationally known for its choir program, Parker was a very popular
                    high school student, connected to his position as the head of the choir. He was typically the lead
                    in school plays and was also prom king. While in school, Parker had a part-time job at a Pizza
                    Hut and was described as a film geek and music buff.</p>

                <p>Following his graduation from high school in 1988, Parker spent a semester at Berklee College of
                    Music before transferring to the University of Colorado at Boulder. During his time there, he
                    took a film class in which students were required to collaborate on projects. In the course, he
                    met Matt Stone—a math major from the nearby town of Littleton—and the two immediately bonded over
                    provocative, anti-authoritarian humor and Monty Python. Parker's first film was titled Giant
                    Beavers of Southern Sri Lanka (1989), parodying Godzilla-style rampages with beavers; fellow student
                    Jason McHugh later remarked that the idea nearly got him laughed out of class. Parker and
                    Stone wrote and acted in many short films together, among those First Date, Man on Mars and Job
                    Application. Parker later remarked that he and Stone would shoot a film nearly every week,
                    but he has since lost most of them. Parker first used a construction paper animation technique
                    on American History (1992), a short film made for his college animation class. It became an
                    unexpected sensation, resulting in Parker's first award—a Student Academy Award. Parker recalled
                    sitting in the auditorium in front of students from animation schools such as CalArts, saying:
                </p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p>"And there are all these Cal Arts kids behind me who had submitted these beautiful watercolor and
                        pencil things. And here's my shitty construction-paper thing-which makes South Park look like
                        Disney, by the way, and they're all fuming".</p>

                <h6 class="subtitle">Cannibal! The Musical (1992–1994)</h6>

                <p>In 1992, Parker, Stone, McHugh, and Ian Hardin founded a production company named the Avenging
                    Conscience, named after the D. W. Griffith film by the same name, which all four actively
                    disliked. Parker again employed the cutout paper technique on Avenging Conscience's first
                    production, Jesus vs. Frosty (1992), an animated short pitting the religious figure against Frosty
                    the Snowman.</p>

                    alt="Cannibal Mucial poster">

                <p>The quartet created a three-minute trailer for a fictional film titled Alferd Packer: The Musical.
                    The idea was based on an obsession Parker had with Alferd Packer, a real nineteenth-century
                    prospector accused of cannibalism. During this time, Parker had become engaged to long-time
                    girlfriend Liane Adamo, but their relationship fell apart shortly before production on the trailer
                    had begun. "Horribly depressed", Parker funneled his frustrations with her into the project,
                    naming Packer's "beloved but disloyal" horse after her. The trailer became somewhat of a
                    sensation among students at the school, leading Virgil Grillo, the chairman and founder of the
                    university's film department, to convince the quartet to expand it to a feature-length film.
                    Parker wrote the film's script, creating an Oklahoma!-style musical featuring ten original show
                    tunes. The group raised $125,000 from family and friends and began shooting the film. The film
                    was shot on Loveland Pass as winter was ending, and the crew endured the freezing weather.
                    Parker—under the pseudonym Juan Schwartz—was the film's star, director and co-producer.</p>

                <p>Alferd Packer: The Musical premiered in Boulder in October 1993; "they rented a limousine that
                    circled to ferry every member of the cast and crew from the back side of the block to the red carpet
                    at the theater's entrance." The group submitted the film to the Sundance Film Festival, who did
                    not respond. Parker told McHugh he had a "vision" they needed to be at the festival, which resulted
                    in the group renting out a conference room in a nearby hotel and putting on their own screenings.
                    MTV did a short news segment on The Big Picture regarding the film, and they made industry
                    connections through the festival. They intended to sell video rights to the film for $1
                    million and spend the remaining $900,000 to create another film. The film was instead sold to
                    Troma Entertainment in 1996 where it was retitled Cannibal! The Musical, and upon the duo's later
                    success, it became their biggest-selling title. It has since been labeled a "cult classic" and
                    adapted into a stage play by community theater groups and even high schools nationwide.</p>

                <h6 class="subtitle">The Spirit of Christmas and Orgazmo (1995–1997)</h6>

                <p>Following the film's success, the group, sans Hardin, moved to Los Angeles. Upon arrival, they
                    met a lawyer for the William Morris Agency who connected them with producer Scott Rudin. As a
                    result, the duo acquired a lawyer, an agent, and a script deal. Despite initially believing
                    themselves to be on the verge of success, the duo struggled for several years. Stone slept on dirty
                    laundry for upwards of a year because he could not afford to purchase a mattress. They
                    unsuccessfully pitched a children's program titled Time Warped to Fox Kids, which would have
                    involved fictionalized stories of people in history. The trio created two separate pilots, spaced
                    a year apart, and despite the approval of Fox Broadcasting Company development executive Pam Brady,
                    the network disbanded the Fox Kids division.</p>

                <p>David Zucker, who was a fan of Cannibal!, contacted the duo to produce a 15-minute short film for
                    Seagram to show at a party for its acquisition of Universal Studios. Due to a misunderstanding,
                    Parker and Stone improvised much of the film an hour before it was shot, creating it as a spoof of
                    1950s instructional videos. The result, Your Studio and You, features numerous celebrities,
                    including Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, and Steven Spielberg. "You could probably make a feature
                    film out of the experience of making that movie because it was just two dudes from college suddenly
                    directing Steven Spielberg," Parker later remarked, noting that the experience was difficult for the
                    two.</p>

                <p>During the time between shooting the pilots for Time Warped, Parker penned the script for a film
                    titled Orgazmo, which later entered production. Half of the budget for the picture came from a
                    Japanese porn company called Kuki, who wanted to feature its performers in mainstream Western
                    media. Independent distributor October Films purchased the rights to the film for one million
                    dollars after its screening at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film received an
                    NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, which resulted in the poor box office
                    performance of the film. Parker and Stone attempted to negotiate with the organization on what to
                    delete from the final print, but the MPAA would not give specific notes. The duo later theorized
                    that the organization cared less because it was an independent distributor which would bring it
                    significantly less money.</p>

                    alt="Jesus vs Frosty image">

                <p>Parker and Stone also made a short film called The Spirit of Christmas (although it is now usually
                    called Jesus vs. Frosty). Brian Graden (then at Fox) liked this short and asked Parker and Stone
                    to produce a video greeting card (for which he paid with his own money) he could send to friends,
                    this film is now usually known as Jesus vs. Santa. Both Jesus vs. Frosty and Jesus vs. Santa had The
                    Spirit of Christmas as opening credits. Graden sent the film on VHS to several industry executives
                    in Hollywood; meanwhile, someone digitized the short film and put it on Internet, where it became
                    one of the first viral videos. As Jesus vs. Santa became more popular, Parker and Stone
                    began talks of developing the short into a television series called South Park. They first pitched
                    the show to Fox, but the network refused to pick it up due to not wanting to air a show that
                    included the talking poo character Mr. Hankey. The two were initially skeptical of possible
                    television deals, noting that previous endeavors had not turned out successful, but then entered
                    negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy
                    Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show. When Comedy Central executive Doug
                    Herzog watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.</p>

                <h5>South Park:</h5>
                <br />
                <h6 class="subtitle">Premiere and initial success (1997–1998)</h6>

                <p>The pilot episode of South Park was made on a budget of $300,000, and took between three to three
                    and a half months to complete, and animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios, in
                    Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Similarly to Parker and Stone's Christmas
                    shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop-motion animation
                    techniques. The idea for the town of South Park came from the real Colorado basin of the same
                    name where, according to the creators, a lot of folklore and news reports originated about "UFO
                    sightings, and cattle mutilations, and Bigfoot sightings."</p>

                <p>At the time, Comedy Central had a low distribution of just 21 million subscribers. The company
                    marketed the show aggressively before its launch, billing it as "why they created the V-chip."
                    The resulting buzz led to the network earning an estimated $30 million in T-shirts sales alone
                    before the first episode was even aired. South Park premiered in August 1997 and immediately
                    became one of the most popular shows on cable television, averaging consistently between 3.5 and 5.5
                    million viewers. The show transformed the fledgling network into "a cable industry power almost
                    overnight." Due to the success of the series' first six episodes, Comedy Central requested an
                    additional seven; the series completed its first season in February 1998. An affiliate
                    of the MTV Network until then, Comedy Central decided, in part due to the success of South Park, to
                    have its own independent sales department. By the end of 1998, Comedy Central had sold more than
                    $150 million worth of merchandise for the show, including T-shirts and dolls. Over the next few
                    years, Comedy Central's viewership spiked largely due to South Park, adding 3 million new
                    subscribers in the first half of 1998 alone, and allowed the network to sign international deals
                    with networks in several countries.</p>

                <p>Parker and Stone became celebrities as a result of the program's success; Parker noted that the
                    success of South Park allowed him to pursue, for a time, a lifestyle that involved partying with
                    women and "out-of-control binges" in Las Vegas. Their philosophy of taking every deal (which had
                    surfaced as a result of their lack of trust in the early success of South Park) led to their
                    appearances in films, albums, and outside script deals. Among these included BASEketball, a 1998
                    comedy film that became a critical and commercial flop, and rights to produce a prequel to Dumb and
                    Dumber, which was never completed.</p>

                <p>Parker and Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing
                    South Park episodes until 1999, gave them a slice of the lucrative spinoff merchandising the show
                    generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show
                    to the big screen, in theaters. During the time, the team was also busy writing the second and
                    third seasons of the series, the former of which Parker and Stone later described as "disastrous".
                    As such, they figured the phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully
                    committed musical. Parker and Stone fought with the MPAA to keep the film R-rated; for months
                    the ratings board insisted on the more prohibitive NC-17. The film was only certified an R
                    rating two weeks prior to its release, following contentious conversations between Parker/Stone,
                    Rudin, and Paramount Pictures. Parker felt very overwhelmed and overworked during the production
                    process of the film, especially between April and the film's opening in late June. He admitted that
                    press coverage, which proclaimed the end of South Park was near, bothered him. South Park:
                    Bigger, Longer & Uncut opened in cinemas in June 1999 and received critical acclaim while grossing
                    $83 million at the box office.</p>

                <p>Parker and Stone continue to write, direct, and voice most characters on South Park. Over time, the
                    show has adopted a unique production process, in which an entire episode is written, animated and
                    broadcast in one week. Parker and Stone state that subjecting themselves to a one-week deadline
                    creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a
                    funnier show. Although initial reviews for the show were negative in reference to its crass
                    humor, the series has received numerous accolades, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, a Peabody
                    Award, and numerous inclusions in various publications' lists of greatest television shows. Though
                    its viewership is lower than it was at the height of its popularity in its earliest seasons, South
                    Park remains one of the highest-rated series on Comedy Central. In 2012, South Park cut back
                    from producing 14 episodes per year (seven in the spring and seven in the fall) to a single run of
                    10 episodes in the fall, to allow the duo to explore other projects the rest of the year. As of
                    2019 the show is renewed through 2022, when it will reach its twenty-sixth season. The show's
                    twenty-third season premiered on September 25, 2019.</p>

                <p>South Park has continued, becoming an enterprise worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The franchise
                    has also expanded to music and video games. Comedy Central released various albums, including Chef
                    Aid: The South Park Album and Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics, in the late 1990s. The
                    song "Chocolate Salty Balls" (as sung by the character Chef) was released as a single in the UK in
                    1998 to support the Chef Aid: The South Park Album and became a number one hit. Parker and Stone
                    had little to do with the development of video games based on the series that were released at this
                    time, but took full creative control of South Park: The Stick of Truth, a 2014 video game
                    based on the series that received positive reviews and for which they shared (with Eric
                    Fenstermaker) the 2014 Writing In A Comedy and Parker won the Performance in a Comedy, Supporting
                    award by National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR). Broadcast syndication
                    rights to South Park were sold in 2003, and all episodes are available for free full-length
                    on-demand legal streaming on the official South Park Studios website. In 2007, the duo, with the
                    help of their lawyer, Kevin Morris, cut a 50-50 joint venture with Comedy Central on all revenue not
                    related to television; this includes digital rights to South Park, as well as films, soundtracks,
                    T-shirts and other merchandise, in a deal worth $75 million.</p>

                <p>In 2000, Parker and Stone began plotting a television sitcom starring the winner of the 2000
                    presidential election. The duo were "95 percent sure" that Democratic candidate Al Gore would win,
                    and tentatively titled the show Everybody Loves Al. Parker said the producers did not want to
                    make fun of politics: the main goal was to parody sitcom tropes, such as a lovable main
                    character, the sassy maid, and the wacky neighbor. They threw a party the night of the election
                    with the writers, with intentions to begin writing the following Monday and shooting the show in
                    January 2001 with the inauguration. With the confusion of whom the President would be, the show's
                    production was pushed back. The show was filmed at Sony Pictures Studios, and was the first time
                    Parker and Stone shot a show on a production lot.</p>

                <p>Although That's My Bush!, which ran between April and May 2001, received a fair amount of publicity
                    and critical notice, according to Stone and Parker, the cost per episode was too high, "about $1
                    million an episode." Comedy Central officially cancelled the series in August 2001 as a
                    cost-cutting move; Stone was quoted as saying "A super-expensive show on a small cable network...the
                    economics of it were just not going to work." Comedy Central continued the show in reruns,
                    considering it a creative and critical success. Parker believed the show would not have survived
                    after the September 11 attacks anyway, and Stone agreed, saying the show would not "play
                    well". During this time, the duo also signed a deal with Shockwave.com to produce 39
                    animated online shorts, in which they would retain full artistic control; the result, Princess, was
                    rejected after only two episodes.</p>

                <h6 class="subtitle">Team America (2002–2004)</h6>

                <img src="/src/img/other/team_america.jpg" class="team-america-image img-thumbnail rounded"
                    alt="Team America poster">

                <p>In 2002, the duo began working on Team America: World Police, a satire of big-budget action films and
                    their associated clichés and stereotypes, with particular humorous emphasis on the global
                    implications of the politics of the United States.The film was inspired by the 1960s British
                    marionette series, Thunderbirds.</p>

                <p>Starring puppets, Team America was produced using a crew of about 200 people, which sometimes
                    required four people at a time to manipulate a marionette. Although the filmmakers hired three
                    dozen highly skilled marionette operators, execution of some very simple acts by the marionettes
                    proved to be very difficult, with a simple shot such as a character drinking taking a half-day to
                    complete successfully. The deadline for the film's completion took a toll on both filmmakers, as
                    did various difficulties in working with puppets, with Stone, who described the film as "the worst
                    time of [my] life", resorting to coffee to work 20-hour days and sleeping pills to go to
                    bed. The film was barely completed in time for its October release date, but reviews
                    were positive and the film made a modest sum at the box office.</p>

                <h4>Personal life</h4>

                <p>Parker married Emma Sugiyama in 2006. The officiant was 1970s sitcom producer Norman Lear.
                    The marriage ended in divorce in 2008.</p>

                <p>Parker subsequently began a relationship with Boogie Tillmon, whom he later married in 2014. Parker
                    gained a stepson through this relationship. Their daughter, Betty Boogie Parker, was born in
                    2013. The couple divorced in 2019, citing irreconcilable differences. While they
                    remain divorced, they have since reconciled to co-parent their child.</p>

                <p>Parker resides in Los Angeles, California. He owns properties in Steamboat Springs, Colorado;
                    Kauai, Hawaii; Seattle, Washington; and Midtown Manhattan in New York City.</p>

                <p>In a September 2006 edition of the ABC News program Nightline, Parker expressed his views on
                    religion, stating that he believes in "a God" and that "there is knowledge that humanity does not
                    yet possess" while cautioning that it would take a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his
                    belief in God. Parker believes all religions are "silly". He stated: "All the religions are super
                    funny to me... The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent His only Son. Why could God only
                    have one son and why would He have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible
                    in about the second act." Parker further remarked,</p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p>Basically... out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully
                        ridiculous—the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah... there's this big giant universe and
                        it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause... just
                        'cause'. That, to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>A 2001 Los Angeles Times article described Parker as "not overly political" and quoted him as saying
                    he was "a registered Libertarian". In 2004, Parker summed up his views with the comment:</p>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    <p>What we're sick of—and it's getting even worse—is: you either like Michael Moore or you wanna
                        fuckin' go overseas and shoot Iraqis. There can't be a middle ground. Basically, if you think
                        Michael Moore's full of shit, then you are a super-Christian right-wing whatever. And we're both
                        just pretty middle-ground guys. We find just as many things to rip on on the left as we do on
                        the right. People on the far left and the far right are the same exact person to us.</p>
